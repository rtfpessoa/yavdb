  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`yamldotnet`][1]provides low level parsing and emitting of YAML as well
    as a high level object model similar to XmlDocument.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution.

    The `Deserializer.Deserialize()` function deserializes user-controlled
    types and blindly instantiates them. An attacker may send a specually
    crafted yaml file, which will then execute code in the context of the
    running process.
