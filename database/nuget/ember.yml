  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |+
    In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before
    inserting it in strings that will be sent to innerHTML. However, the
    `tagName` property of an `Ember.View` was inserted into such a string
    without being sanitized. This means that if an application assigns a
    view\'s `tagName` to user-supplied data, a specially-crafted payload
    could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain
    (XSS).

    \nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a
    legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as
    originating from a trusted source.

    This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web
    application then delivers that data to its users along with other
    trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly
    executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side
    languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that
    are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.

    ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is
    exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this
    manipulation is the top method for securing code against this
    vulnerability.

    Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and
    particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those
    characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example,
    in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in
    order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while
    within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious
    content is injected into an application that escapes special characters
    and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those
    characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser
    if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this
    way the attempted attack is diverted.

    The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP
    HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to
    expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and
    functionality and deliver malware.

    ### Types of attacks   {#types-of-attacks}

    There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:

    | Type | Origin | Description |
    |----------
    | **Stored** | Server | The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link. |
    | **Reflected** | Server | The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. |
    | **DOM-based** | Client | The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data. |
    | **Mutated** |  | The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters. |

    ### Affected environments   {#affected-environments}

    The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:

    * Web servers
    * Application servers
    * Web application environments

    ### How to prevent   {#how-to-prevent}

    This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically
    protect your code:

    * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back,
      ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing
      anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters
      during searches.
    * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces
      to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.
    * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.
    * Redirect invalid requests.
    * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP
      addresses, and invalidate those sessions.
    * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to
      disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.
    * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your
      code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.

    Potential XSS Exploit With User-Supplied Data When Using `{{group}}`
    Helper

    In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before
    inserting it in strings that will be sent to innerHTML. However, a
    vulnerability has been identified that could lead to unescaped content
    being inserted into the innerHTML string without being sanitized.

    \nWhen using the `{{group}}` helper, user supplied content in the template
    was not being sanitized. Though the vulnerability exists in Ember.js
    proper, it is only exposed via the use of an experimental plugin.

    In applications that use the `{{group}}` helper, a specially-crafted
    payload could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current
    domain (\"XSS\").

    **Impact**\:

    This vulnerability only affects applications that use the `{{group}}`
    helper to display user-provided content.

    \nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a
    legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as

    Potential XSS Exploit With User-Supplied Data When Binding Primitive
    Values

    In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before
    inserting it in strings that will be sent to innerHTML. However, a
    vulnerability that could lead to unescaped content being inserted into
    the innerHTML string without being sanitized has been identified.

    When a primitive value is used as the Handlebars context, that value is
    not properly escaped. An example of this would be using the `{{each}}`
    helper to iterate over an array of user-supplied strings and using
    `{{this}}` inside the block to display each string.

    In applications that contain templates whose context is a primitive
    value and use the `{{this}}` keyword to display that value, a
    specially-crafted payload could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the
    context of the current domain (\"XSS\").

    **Impact:**

    This vulnerability affects applications that contain templates whose
    context is set to a user-supplied primitive value (such as a string or
    number) and also contain the `{{this}}` special Handlebars variable to
    display the value.

    \nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a
    legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as
    originating from a trusted source.

    This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web
