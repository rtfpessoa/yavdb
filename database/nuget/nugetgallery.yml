  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: |
    [NuGetGallery][1] is a Core support library for NuGet Gallery Frontend
    and Backend.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation. A spoofing vulnerability exists when the NuGetGallery does
    not properly sanitize input on package metadata values. . An attacker
    who successfully exploited the vulnerability could perform cross-site
    scripting attacks and run scripts in the security context of the user
    viewing the malicious content. To exploit this vulnerability, an
    attacker with permissions to upload packages could publish specially
    crafted content on a gallery page.
