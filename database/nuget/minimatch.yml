  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
  description: |
    [`minimatch`][1] is a minimalistic matching library used for converting
    glob expressions into JavaScript RegExp objects. Affected versions of
    this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service
    (ReDoS) attacks.

    The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of
    Service attack. Many Regular Expression implementations may reach edge
    cases that causes them to work very slowly (exponentially related to
    input size), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the
    program to enter these extreme situations by using a specially crafted
    input and cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a
    Denial of Service.

    An attacker can provide a long value to the `minimatch` function, which
    nearly matches the pattern being matched. This will cause the regular
    expression matching to take a long time, all the while occupying the
    event loop and preventing it from processing other requests and making
    the server unavailable (a Denial of Service attack).

    You can read more about `Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)`
    on our [blog][2].
