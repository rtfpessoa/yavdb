  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [system.net.http][1] is an interface for modern HTTP applications,
    including HTTP client components that allow applications to consume web
    services over HTTP and HTTP components that can be used by both clients
    and servers for parsing HTTP headers.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS) as `ASP.NET Core` fails to properly validate web requests.

    **NOTE:** Microsoft has not commented on third-party claims that the
    issue is that the `TextEncoder.EncodeCore` function in the
    `System.Text.Encodings.Web` package in ASP.NET Core Mvc before 1.0.4 and
    1.1.x before 1.1.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    by leveraging failure to properly calculate the length of 4-byte
    characters in the Unicode Non-Character range.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Improper Certificate Validation
  description: |
    [system.net.http][1] is an interface for modern HTTP applications,
    including HTTP client components that allow applications to consume web
    services over HTTP and HTTP components that can be used by both clients
    and servers for parsing HTTP headers.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Certificate
    Validation. It allows an attacker to bypass *Enhanced Security Usage*
    tagging when they present a certificate that is invalid for a specific
    use.

    [system.net.http][1] interface for modern HTTP applications, including
    HTTP client components that allow applications to consume web services
    over HTTP and HTTP components that can be used by both clients and
    servers for parsing HTTP headers.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. When HTTP authentication information is inadvertently exposed
    in an outbound request that encounters an HTTP redirect. An attacker who
    successfully exploited this vulnerability could use the information to
    further compromise the web application.

    Noe: The presence of `System.Net.Http` in the dependency graph of
    `netcoreapp2.0` isn\'t the final determination of what is loaded at
    runtime. The version conflict resolution logic will prefer what is
    present in `Microsoft.NETCore.App/2.1.5`, or latest patch release. As
    such, is not considered to an issue.
