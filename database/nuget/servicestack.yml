  title: Signature Validation Bypass
  description: |
    [ServiceStack][1] is a simple and fast alternative to WCF, MVC and Web
    API in one cohesive framework for all your services and web apps.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Signature Validation
    Bypass. It mishandles JWT signature verification unless an application
    has a custom ValidateToken function that establishes a valid minimum
    length for a signature.
