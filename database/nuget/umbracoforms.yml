  title: Insecure Defaults
  description: "[UmbracoForms][1] is a tool that makes creating contact forms, entry\nforms
    and questionnaires just as easy as using Word.\n\nAffected versions of this package
    are vulnerable to Insecure Defaults.\nWhen using the default configuration for
    upload forms, it is possible to\nupload arbitrary file types.\n\nThe package offers
    a way for users to mitigate the issue. The users of\nthis package can create a
    custom workflow and frontend validation that\nblocks certain file types, depending
    on their security needs and\npolicies.\n\n### PoC by Adrian Gigliotti   {#poc-by-adrian-gigliotti}\n\n1.
    \ Submit a malicious file through a file upload form created using\n    UmbracoForms
    with default configuration.\n2.  In the administrator\\'s view, you can verify
    that the file has been\n    stored and is available for interaction.\n    ## Remediation
    \  {#remediation}\n    \n    There is no fixed version for `UmbracoForms`.\n    ##
