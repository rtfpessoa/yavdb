  title: Security Bypass
  description: |
    [Microsoft.Owin][1] is a Provides a set of helper types and abstractions
    for simplifying the creation of OWIN components.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Security Bypass. The
    ASP.NET Core cookie parser decodes entire cookie strings which could
    allow a malicious attacker to set a second cookie with the name being
    percent encoded. The security update addresses the vulnerability by
    fixing the way the ASP.NET Core cookie parser handles encoded names.
