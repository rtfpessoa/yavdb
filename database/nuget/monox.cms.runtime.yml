  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [MonoX.CMS.Runtime][1] is a Free ASP.NET CMS and Social Networking
    Platform.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. It allows admins to execute arbitrary programs by
    reconfiguring the Converter Executable setting from `ffmpeg.exe` to a
    different program.

  title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  description: |
    [MonoX.CMS.Runtime][1] is a Free ASP.NET CMS and Social Networking
    Platform.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of
    Untrusted Data. It allows remote code execution via `HTML5Upload.ashx`
    or `Pages/SocialNetworking/lng/en-US/PhotoGallery.aspx` because of
    unsafe deserialization in `ModuleGallery.HTML5Upload`,
    `ModuleGallery.SilverLightUploadModule`, `HTML5Upload`, and
    `SilverLightUploadHandler`.

    \nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of
    bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent
    through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of
    bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for
    communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence
    (store the object state in a file or a database).

    *Deserialization of untrusted data* ([CWE-502][1]), is when the
    application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying
    that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control
    the state or the flow of the execution.

    An attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a
    vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted
    data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the
    deserializer, getting the command executed.
