  title: Replay Attack
  description: |
    [Sustainsys.Saml2][1] is a SAML2 protocol support.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Replay Attack. Token
    Replay Detection is an important defence in depth measure for Single
    Sign On solutions. In all previous 2.X versions, the Token Replay
    Detection is not properly implemented.

    Note that version 1.0.1 is not affected. It has a correct Token Replay
    Implementation and is safe to use.
