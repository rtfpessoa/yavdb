  title: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information
  description: |
    [Sustainsys.Saml2][1] is a SAML2 protocol support.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Storage of
    Sensitive Information. It has a faulty implementation of Token Replay
    Detection. Token Replay Detection is an important defence in depth
    measure for Single Sign On solutions.

  title: Replay Attack
  description: |
    [Sustainsys.Saml2][1] is a SAML2 protocol support.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Replay Attack. Token
    Replay Detection is an important defence in depth measure for Single
    Sign On solutions. In all previous 2.X versions, the Token Replay
    Detection is not properly implemented.

    Note that version 1.0.1 is not affected. It has a correct Token Replay
    Implementation and is safe to use.

  title: Insecure Token Validation
  description: |
    [Sustainsys.Saml2][1] is a SAML2 protocol support.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Token
    Validation. It incorrectly treats all incoming tokens as bearer tokens,
    even though they have another subject confirmation method specified.
    This could be used by an attacker that could get access to Saml2 tokens
    with another subject confirmation method than bearer. The attacker could
    then use such a token to create a log in session.
