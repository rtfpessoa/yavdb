  title: Arbitrary Code Injection
  description: |
    [FastReport.OpenSource][1] is a reporting solution for .Net Core 2.x and
    .Net Framework 4.x. Various report objects will allow your report to
    look exactly how you want it to: 13 types of bands, 25 types of
    barcodes, table object, shapes, line, PolyLine, Polygon and many more.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Injection. It lacks a ScriptSecurity feature and therefore may mishandle
    (for example) `GetType`, `typeof`, `TypeOf`, `DllImport`, `LoadLibrary`,
    and `GetProcAddress`.
