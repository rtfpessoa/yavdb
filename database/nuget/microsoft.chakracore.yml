    [Microsoft.ChakraCore][1] is the core part of the Chakra Javascript
    engine that powers Microsoft Edge

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). An attacker may bypass the Control Flow Guard (CFG). By
    itself, the vulnerability does not allow arbitrary code execution.
    However, an attacker could use the CFG in conjunction with another
    vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, to run
    arbitrary code on a target system.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in
    Microsoft Edge as a result of how memory is accessed in code compiled by
    the Edge `Just-In-Time` (JIT) compiler that allows Control Flow Guard
    (CFG) to be bypassed. By itself, this CFG bypass vulnerability does not
    allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use the CFG
    bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as
    a remote code execution vulnerability, to run arbitrary code on a target
    system.

  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [Microsoft.ChakraCore][1] is a core part of the Chakra Javascript engine
    that powers Microsoft Edge

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE) due to the way the scripting engine handles objects in
    memory in Microsoft browsers. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in
    such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context
    of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the
    vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If
    the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an
    attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control
    of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view,
    change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

  description: |
    [Microsoft.ChakraCore][1] is a core part of the Chakra Javascript engine
    that powers Microsoft Edge

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE) when the Control Flow Guard (CFG) could be bypassed. By
    itself, the CFG bypass vulnerability does not allow arbitrary code
    execution. However, an attacker could use the CFG bypass in conjunction
    with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution
    vulnerability, to run arbitrary code on a target system.

    Execution (RCE). A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way
    the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft browsers.
    The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker
    could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An
    attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the
    same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on
    with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited
    the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker
    could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new
    accounts with full user rights.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE) due to the way that the scripting engine handles objects
    in memory in Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in
    such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context
    of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the
    vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If
    the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an
    attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control
    of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view,
    change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE) due to the way that the scripting engine handles objects
    in memory in Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in
    such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context
    of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the
    vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If
    the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an
    attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control
    of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view,
    change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [Microsoft.ChakraCore][1] is the core part of the Chakra Javascript
    engine that powers Microsoft Edge.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). A remote code execution vulnerability exists when
    Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability
    could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute
    arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who
    successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights
    as the current user. If the current user is logged on with
    administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an
    affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change,
    or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

    Execution (RCE) due to the way that the scripting engine handles objects
    in memory in Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in
    such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context
    of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the
    vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If
    the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an
    attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control
    of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view,
    change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

    [Microsoft.ChakraCore][1] is a core part of the Chakra Javascript engine
    that powers Microsoft Edge

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE) due to the way that Microsoft browsers access objects in
    memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in a way that could allow
    an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current
    user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could
    gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is
    logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take
    control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs;
    view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user
    rights.

  description: |
    [Microsoft.ChakraCore][1] is the core part of the Chakra Javascript
    engine that powers Microsoft Edge

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution due to the way that the Chakra scripting engine handles
    objects in memory in Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability could corrupt
    memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in
    the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited
    the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user.
    If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an
    attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control
    of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view,
    change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [Microsoft.ChakraCore][1] is a core part of the Chakra Javascript engine
    that powers Microsoft Edge

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that
    the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge
    (HTML-based)L. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that
    an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current
    user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could
    gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is
    logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully
    exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An
    attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or
    create new accounts with full user rights.

  description: |
    [Microsoft.ChakraCore][1] is a core part of the Chakra Javascript engine
    that powers Microsoft Edge

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Chakra
    improperly discloses the contents of its memory, which could provide an
    attacker with information to further compromise the user’s computer or
    data.

  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [Microsoft.ChakraCore][1] is a core part of the Chakra Javascript engine
    that powers Microsoft Edge

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way
    that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the
    current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability
    could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user
    is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who
    successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an
    affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change,
    or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

    attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites
    that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These
    websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the
    vulnerability.
