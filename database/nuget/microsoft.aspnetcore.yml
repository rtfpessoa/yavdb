  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [Microsoft.AspNetCore][1] is an open-source and cross-platform framework
    for building modern cloud based internet connected applications, such as
    web apps, IoT apps and mobile backends.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). when ASP.NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker
    who successfully exploited this vulnerability remotely, without
    authentication and may cause denial of service against an ASP.NET Core
    web application.

    \*\* NOTE: The vulnerability affects any Microsoft ASP.NET Core 2.2
    applications if it is hosted on an IIS server running AspNetCoreModuleV2
    (ANCM) prior to and including version 12.2.19024.2.

    The vulnerability affects any Microsoft ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1/2.1
    application if they have explicitly opted into using the newer
    AspNetCoreModuleV2 (ANCM) prior to and including version 12.2.19024.2.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
