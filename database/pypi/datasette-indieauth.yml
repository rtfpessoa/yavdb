  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [datasette-indieauth][1] is a Datasette authentication using IndieAuth
    and RelMeAuth

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. A malicious user could sign in as a user with any IndieAuth
    identifier. This is because the implementation does not verify that the
    final `"me"` URL value returned by the authorization server belongs to
    the same domain as the initial value entered by the user.
