  title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  description: |
    [parso][1] is a Python parser that supports error recovery and
    round-trip parsing for different Python versions.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of
    Untrusted Data. A deserialization vulnerability exists in the way parso
    handles grammar parsing from the cache. Cache loading relies on pickle
    and, provided that an evil pickle can be written to a cache grammar file
    and that its parsing can be triggered, this flaw leads to Arbitrary Code
    Execution.
