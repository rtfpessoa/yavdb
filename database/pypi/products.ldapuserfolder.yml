  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [`products.ldapuserfolder`][1] is a LDAP-enabled Zope 2 user folder.

    Affected versions of this package vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass attacks. The authenticate function in
    LDAPUserFolder/LDAPUserFolder.py in zope-ldapuserfolder 2.9-1 does not
    verify the password for the emergency account, which allows remote
    attackers to gain privileges.
