  title: Insecure Permissions
  description: |
    [aws-encryption-sdk-cli][1] is a This command line tool can be used to
    encrypt and decrypt files and directories using the AWS Encryption SDK.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure
    Permissions. In the affected versions, the AWS Encryption CLI operated
    in \"discovery mode\" even when \"strict mode\" was specified. Although
    decryption only succeeded if the user had permission to decrypt with at
    least one of the CMKs, decryption could be successful using a CMK that
    was not included in the user-defined set when the CLI was operating in
    \"strict mode\".
