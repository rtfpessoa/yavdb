  title: Insecure Permissions
  description: |
    [amundsen-frontend][1] is a Web UI for Amundsen

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure
    Permissions. Any install that has `UNEDITABLE_SCHEMAS` and/or
    `UNEDITABLE_TABLE_DESCRIPTION_MATCH_RULES` set in the front-end, is
    being impacted. The value of these properties is ignored if set,
    allowing any user to modify table and column descriptions, even though
    the properties imply they shouldn\'t be.
