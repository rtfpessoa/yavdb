  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [ecdsa][1] is an easy-to-use implementation of ECDSA cryptography
    (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), implemented purely in
    Python, released under the MIT license.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attack.
    Practical recovery of the long-term private key generated by the library
    is possible under certain conditions. Leakage of bit-length of a scalar
    during scalar multiplication is possible on an elliptic curve which
    might allow practical recovery of the long-term private key.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [ecdsa][1] is an easy-to-use implementation of ECDSA cryptography
    (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), implemented purely in
    Python, released under the MIT license.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). During signature decoding, malformed DER signatures could raise
    unexpected exceptions (or no exceptions at all), which could lead to a
    denial of service.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Cryptographic Issues
  description: |
    [ecdsa][1] is an easy-to-use implementation of ECDSA cryptography
    (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), implemented purely in
    Python, released under the MIT license.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cryptographic
    Issues. A flaw exists where signatures used by DER encoding are not
    correctly verified. Without this verification, a malformed signature
    could be accepted, making the signature malleable. Without proper
    verification, an attacker could use a malleable signature to create
    false transactions.
