  title: Remote Code Execution
  description: |
    [pylint][1] is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for
    programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code
    smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution. `python -m pylint` imports user code. It adds the current
    working directory as the first element of `sys.path` this opens up a
    security hole where `pylint` imports user level code as long as that
    code resides in modules with the same name as `stdlib` or `pylint`\'s
    own modules.
