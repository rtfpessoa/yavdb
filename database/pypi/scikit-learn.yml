  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [scikit-learn][1] is a Python module for machine learning built on top
    of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). It can unserialize and execute commands from an
    untrusted file that is passed to the `joblib.load()` function, if
    `__reduce__` makes an os.system call.
