  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [`Twisted`][1] is an asynchronous networking framework written in Python
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. When specifying the trustRoot (CA store) for the HTTP client,
    Twisted did not respect the user\'s specification, and always used the
    default of the platform trust. This means that users attempting to use
    this feature to implement certificate pinning, or otherwise restrict the
    trust CAs would still have accepted any certificate signed by a CA.

  title: Open Redirect
  description: |
    [`twisted`][1] is an asynchronous networking framework written in
    Python.

    Affected versions of this package are is vulnerable to Open HTTP
    Redirects. It was discovered that python-twisted-web used the value of
    the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the `HTTP_PROXY`
    environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was incorrectly used
    by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the proxy for
    outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw
    to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an
    attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request.

  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: |
    [Twisted][1] is an event-based network programming and multi-protocol
    integration framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation due to the package not validating or sanitizing URIs or HTTP
    methods, this allows an attacker to inject invalid characters such as
    CRLF.

  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [Twisted][1] is an event-based network programming and multi-protocol
    integration framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM) via the `words.protocols.jabber.xmlstream`. The XMPP support did
    not verify certificates when used with TLS, allowing an attacker to MITM
    connections.

  title: HTTP Request Splitting
  description: |
    [Twisted][1] is a event-based network programming and multi-protocol
    integration framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Request
    Splitting. When presented with a `content-length` and a chunked encoding
    header, the `content-length` took precedence and the remainder of the
    request body was interpreted as a pipelined request.

  title: HTTP Request Smuggling
  description: |
    [Twisted][1] is a event-based network programming and multi-protocol
    integration framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Request
    Smuggling. When presented with two `content-length` headers, it ignored
    the first header. When the second content-length value was set to zero,
    the request body was interpreted as a pipelined request.

  title: HTTP Header Injection
  description: |+
    `twisted` is a None

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Header
    Injection. `twisted.web.client.Request` and
    `twisted.web.client.HTTPClient` are both vulnerable to header injection
    attacks due to not properly sanitising linear whitespace (\'\\r\',
    \'\\n\', and \'\\r\\n\').
