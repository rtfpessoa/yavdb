  title: Improper Verification
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Verification. `verification.py` relies on a static string for signatures
    (i.e., the Django Signing API is misused), which allows remote attackers
    to spoof the verification process. This occurs because incorrect code
    refactoring led to calling a security-critical function with an
    incorrect argument.
