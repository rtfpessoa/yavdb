  title: Buffer Overflow
  description: |
    [tensorflow][1] is a machine learning framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. A
    malicious user could pass a malformed version of a `TFLite` graph into
    `TOCO` will cause `TOCO` to crash or cause a buffer overflow,
    potentially allowing malicious code to be executed.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [tensorflow][1] is a machine learning framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). It was possible to pass a `null` value into `strcat` when parsing
    a GIF, causing DoS attacks.



    [1]: https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Out-of-bounds Read.
    A malicious user could crash the process or gain access to unintended
    regions of the process memory.

  title: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
  description: |
    [tensorflow][1] is a machine learning framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Heap-based Buffer
    Overflow via `UnsortedSegmentSum`. When the Index template argument is
    int32 `data_size` and `num_segments` fields are truncated from int64 to
    int32 and can produce negative numbers, resulting in accessing out of
    bounds heap memory.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [tensorflow][1] is a machine learning framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). Converting a string (from Python) to a `tf.float16` value results
    in a segmentation fault in eager mode as the format checks for this use
    case are only in the graph mode. A malicious attacker can send a data
    point which contains a string instead of a `tf.float16` value. Similar
    effects can be obtained by manipulating saved models and checkpoints
    whereby replacing a scalar `tf.float16` value with a scalar string will
    trigger this issue due to automatic conversions.
