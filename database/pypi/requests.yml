  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`requests`][1] is a Python HTTP for Humans.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    attacks. Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in the
    `ssl.match_hostname` function in Python 3.2.x, 3.3.x, and earlier, and
    unspecified versions of `python-backports-ssl_match_hostname` as used
    for older Python versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service (CPU consumption) via multiple wildcard characters in the common
    name in a certificate.



    [1]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

    [`requests`][1] is a Python HTTP for Humans.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTPoxy attacks. The
    Python `CGIHandler` class did not properly protect against the
    `HTTP_PROXY` variable. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
    redirect HTTP requests performed by a Python CGI script to an
    attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request.

    [`requests`][1] is a Python HTTP for Humans.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS) attacks. When sending a digest with an incorrect password, it will
    retry the request for infinity. An attacker can send many of these
    requests, causing a denial of service.

  title: Information Exposure

    [Requests][1] is a *Non-GMO* HTTP library for Python

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. Upon receiving a same-hostname https-to-http redirect, it
    sends the HTTP Authorization header to an http URI. This makes it easier
    for remote attackers to discover credentials by sniffing the network.
