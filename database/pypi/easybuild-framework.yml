  title: Information Disclosure
  description: |
    [easybuild-framework][1] is a software build and installation framework
    that allows you to manage (scientific) software on High Performance
    Computing (HPC) systems in an efficient way.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Disclosure. The GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) used by EasyBuild for
    the GitHub integration features (like `--new-pr`, `--from-pr`, etc.) is
    shown in plain text in EasyBuild debug log files. This issue is fixed in
    EasyBuild v4.1.2, and in the `master`+ `develop` branches of the
    `easybuild-framework` repository.
