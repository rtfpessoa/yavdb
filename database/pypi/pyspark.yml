  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [pyspark][1] is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big
    Data.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. In certain situations Spark would write user data to local
    disk unencrypted, even if `spark.io.encryption.enabled=true`. This
    includes cached blocks that are fetched to disk (controlled by
    `spark.maxRemoteBlockSizeFetchToMem`); in SparkR, using parallelize; in
    Pyspark, using broadcast and parallelize; and use of python udfs.
