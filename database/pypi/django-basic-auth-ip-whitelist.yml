  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [django-basic-auth-ip-whitelist][1] is a Hide your Django site behind
    basic authentication mechanism with IP whitelisting support.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attack.
    Potential timing attack exists on websites where the basic
    authentication is used or configured, i.e. `BASIC_AUTH_LOGIN` and
    `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` is set. Currently the string comparison between
    configured credentials and the ones provided by users is performed
    through a character-by-character string comparison. This enables a
    possibility that attacker may time the time it takes the server to
    validate different usernames and password, and use this knowledge to
    work out the valid credentials.
