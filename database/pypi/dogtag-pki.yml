  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [dogtag-pki][1] is a Client library for Dogtag Certificate System

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM). The `pki.client.PKIConnection` class did not enable
    `python-requests` certificate validation. Since the verify parameter was
    hard-coded in all request functions, it was not possible to override the
    setting. As a result, tools making use of this class, such as the
    `pki-server` command, may have been vulnerable to Person-in-the-Middle
    attacks in certain non-localhost use cases.

    *Note*\:This is fixed in 10.9.0-b1 which is not published on PyPi.
