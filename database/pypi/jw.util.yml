  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [jw.util][1] is a package for version handling, YAML configuration and
    file renaming with various backup strategies.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). An exploitable vulnerability exists in the
    configuration-loading functionality of the jw.util package before 2.3
    for Python. When loading a configuration with FromString or FromStream
    with YAML, one can execute arbitrary Python code, resulting in OS
    command execution, because `safe_load` is not used.
