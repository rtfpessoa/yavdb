  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [pandas][1] is a Python package providing data structures designed to
    make working with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially
    heterogeneous) and time series data both easy and intuitive.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). It can unserialize and execute commands from an
    untrusted file that is passed to the `read_pickle()` function, if
    `__reduce__` makes an os.system call.

    **Note:** This issue is disputed because the `read_pickle()` function is
    documented as unsafe.
