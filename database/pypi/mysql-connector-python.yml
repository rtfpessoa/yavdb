  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [mysql-connector-python][1] is a MySQL driver written in Python which
    does not depend on MySQL C client libraries and implements the DB API
    v2.0 specification (PEP-249).

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. An unauthenticated attacker with network access via TLS could
    compromise MySQL Connectors. Successful attacks require human
    interaction from a person other than the attacker. It could result in
    unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data
    or all MySQL Connectors accessible data as well as unauthorized access
    to critical data or complete access to all MySQL Connectors accessible
    data.
