  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [keystone][1] is a package that provides authentication, authorization
    and service discovery mechanisms via HTTP primarily for use by projects
    in the OpenStack family.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. The LDAP backend in OpenStack Identity (Keystone) Grizzly
    and Havana, when removing a role on a tenant for a user who does not
    have that role, adds the role to the user, which allows local users to
    gain privileges.

    [keystone][1] is a package that provides authentication, authorization
    and service discovery mechanisms via HTTP primarily for use by projects
    in the OpenStack family.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege Escalation
    via the list credentials API. Any user with a role on a project is able
    to list any credentials with the `/v3/credentials` API when
    `enforce_scope` is false.

  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [keystone][1] is a package that provides authentication, authorization
    and service discovery mechanisms via HTTP primarily for use by projects
    in the OpenStack family.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. The list of roles provided for an OAuth1 access token is
    silently ignored. Thus, when an access token is used to request a
    keystone token, the keystone token contains every role assignment the
    creator had for the project. This results in the provided keystone token
    having more role assignments than the creator intended, possibly giving
    unintended escalated access.

  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [keystone][1] is a package that provides authentication, authorization
    and service discovery mechanisms via HTTP primarily for use by projects
    in the OpenStack family.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. Any user authenticated within a limited scope
    (trust/oauth/application credential) can create an EC2 credential with
    an escalated permission, such as obtaining admin while the user is on a
    limited viewer role.

    This potentially allows a malicious user to act as the admin on a
    project another user has the admin role on, which can effectively grant
    that user global admin privileges.

  title: Improper Authentication
  description: |
    [keystone][1] is a package that provides authentication, authorization
    and service discovery mechanisms via HTTP primarily for use by projects
    in the OpenStack family.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authentication. The EC2 API doesn\'t have a signature TTL check for AWS
    Signature V4. An attacker can sniff the Authorization header, and then
    use it to reissue an OpenStack token an unlimited number of times.

    in the OpenStack family.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. Any authenticated user can create an EC2 credential for
    themselves for a project that they have a specified role on, and then
    perform an update to the credential user and project, allowing them to
    masquerade as another user. This potentially allows a malicious user to
    act as the admin on a project another user has the admin role on, which
    can effectively grant that user global admin privileges.
