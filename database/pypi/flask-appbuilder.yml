  title: Incorrect Default Permissions
  description: |
    [flask-appbuilder][1] is a simple and rapid application development
    framework, built on top of Flask. includes detailed security, auto CRUD
    generation for your models, google charts and much more.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Incorrect Default
    Permissions. No permissions were required by default in pvm, perm and vm
    mvc `views config` options. The fix gives the user the ability to toggle
    permissions on and off.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [flask-appbuilder][1] is a simple and rapid application development
    framework, built on top of Flask. includes detailed security, auto CRUD
    generation for your models, google charts and much more.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. Attackers were able to masquerade as an authenticated user
    through OAuth providers. The fix changes the ID that is used to link a
    google login to an account to an immutable user ID that is provided by
    google. The previous implementation used the display name, which could
    easily be changed at any point and used to log in to a different account
    by an attacker.
