  title: Improper Check for Dropped Privileges
  description: |
    [`mod_wsgi`][1] is a Installer for Apache/mod\_wsgi. mod\_wsgi before
    4.2.4 for Apache, when creating a daemon process group, does not
    properly handle when group privileges cannot be dropped, which might
    allow attackers to gain privileges via unspecified vectors.
