  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [fastecdsa][1] is a python package for doing fast elliptic curve
    cryptography, specifically digital signatures.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attack.
    Practical recovery of the long-term private key generated by the library
    is possible under certain conditions. Leakage of bit-length of a scalar
    during scalar multiplication is possible on an elliptic curve which
    might allow practical recovery of the long-term private key.

  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [fastecdsa][1] is a python package for doing fast elliptic curve
    cryptography, specifically digital signatures.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attack. When
    using the `NIST P-256` curve in the ECDSA implementation, the point at
    infinity is mishandled. This means that for an extreme value in `k` and
    `s^-1`, the signature verification fails even if the signature is
    correct. There are some threat models where an attacker can benefit by
    successfully guessing users for whom signature verification will fail.
