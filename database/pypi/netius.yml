  title: HTTP Request Smuggling
  description: |
    [netius][1] is a Python network library that can be used for the rapid
    creation of asynchronous non-blocking servers and clients.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Request
    Smuggling. HTTP pipelining issues and request smuggling attacks might be
    possible due to incorrect Transfer encoding header parsing which could
    allow for CL:TE or TE:TE attacks.

    By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache,
    perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests
    other than their own.
