  title: Symlink Attack
  description: |
    [`Pillow`][1] is a Python Imaging Library (Fork).

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Symlink attacks due
    to insecurely creating temporary files. The (1) `load_djpeg` function in
    `JpegImagePlugin.py`, (2) `Ghostscript` function in `EpsImagePlugin.py`,
    (3) load function in `IptcImagePlugin.py`, and (4) copy function in
    `Image.py` do not properly create temporary files, which allow local
    users to overwrite arbitrary files and obtain sensitive information via
    a symlink attack on the temporary file.

    [`Pillow`][1] is a Python Imaging Library (Fork).

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Symlink attacks due
    to insecurely creating temporary files. The (1) `JpegImagePlugin.py` and
    (2) `EpsImagePlugin.py` scripts use the names of temporary files on the
    command line, which makes it easier for local users to conduct symlink
    attacks by listing the processes.

    [`pillow`][1] is a Python Imaging Library (Fork).

    PIL/IcnsImagePlugin.py in Python Imaging Library (PIL) and Pillow before
    2.3.2 and 2.5.x before 2.5.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service via a crafted block size.



    [1]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pillow
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [Pillow][1] is a PIL (Python Imaging Library) fork.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). `FpxImagePlugin.py` calls the range function on an unvalidated
    32-bit integer if the number of bands is large. On Windows running
    32-bit Python, this results in an OverflowError or MemoryError due to
    the 2 GB limit. However, on Linux running 64-bit Python this results in
    the process being terminated by the OOM killer.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
