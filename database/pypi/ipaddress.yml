  title: Cryptographic Issues
  description: |
    [ipaddress][1] is an IPv4/IPv6 manipulation library

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cryptographic
    Issues. The hash`()` methods of classes `IPv4Interface` and
    `IPv6Interface` had issue of generating constant hash values of 32 and
    128 respectively causing hash collisions. The fix uses the `hash()`
    function to generate hash values for the objects instead of XOR
    operation.
