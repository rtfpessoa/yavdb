  title: Hash Collision
  description: |
    [ipaddress][1] is an IPv4/IPv6 manipulation library

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Hash Collision. The
    package improperly computes hash values in the `IPv4Interface` and`
    IPv6Interface` classes, which might allow a remote attacker to cause a
    denial of service if an application is affected by the performance of a
    dictionary containing `IPv4Interface` or `IPv6Interface` objects, and
    this attacker can cause many dictionary entries to be created.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package][1]

  title: Cryptographic Issues
  description: |
    [ipaddress][1] is an IPv4/IPv6 manipulation library

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cryptographic
    Issues. The hash`()` methods of classes `IPv4Interface` and
    `IPv6Interface` had issue of generating constant hash values of 32 and
    128 respectively causing hash collisions. The fix uses the `hash()`
    function to generate hash values for the objects instead of XOR
    operation.
