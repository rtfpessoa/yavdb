  title: Authorization Bypass
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authorization
    Bypass. The deprecated configuration `Authenticator.whitelist`, which
    should be transparently mapped to `Authenticator.allowed_users` with a
    warning, is instead ignored, resulting in the same behaviour as if it
    has not been set.

  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [oauthenticator][1] is an authenticator package.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. When using JupyterHub with GitLab group whitelisting for access
    control, group membership was not checked correctly, allowing members
    not in the whitelisted groups to create accounts on the Hub. (Users were
    not allowed to access other users, accounts, but could create their own
    accounts on the Hub linked to their GitLab account. GitLab
    authentication not using `gitlab_group_whitelist` is unaffected. No
    other Authenticators are affected.)
