  title: Inadequate Encryption Strength
  description: |
    [aws-encryption-sdk][1] is an AWS Encryption SDK implementation for
    Python

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Inadequate
    Encryption Strength. A weak robustness vulnerability exists in the AWS
    Encryption SDKs for Java, Python, C and Javalcript. Due to the
    non-committing property of `AES-GCM` (and other `AEAD` ciphers such as
    `AES-GCM-SIV` or `(X)ChaCha20Poly1305`) used by the SDKs to encrypt
    messages, an attacker can craft a unique cyphertext which will decrypt
    to multiple different results, and becomes especially relevant in a
    multi-recipient setting.
