  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [lookatme][1] is an interactive, terminal-based markdown presenter.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The package automatically loaded the built-in `terminal` and
    `file_loader` extensions. Users that use lookatme to render untrusted
    markdown may have malicious shell commands automatically run on their
    system.
