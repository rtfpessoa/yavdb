  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [Red-DiscordBot][1] is an A highly customisable Discord bot

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege Escalation
    in the `Mod` module. This vulnerability allows Discord users with a high
    privilege level within the guild to bypass hierarchy checks when the
    application is in a specific condition that is beyond that user\'s
    control. By abusing this issue, it\'s possible to perform destructive
    actions within the guild the user has high privileges in.
