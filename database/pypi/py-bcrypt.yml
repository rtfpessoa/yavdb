  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [py-bcrypt][1] is a bcrypt password hashing and key derivation.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. It does not properly handle concurrent memory access, which
    allows attackers to bypass authentication via multiple authentication
    requests, which trigger the password hash to be overwritten.
