  title: DNS Rebinding
  description: |
    [mitmproxy][1] is An interactive, SSL-capable, man-in-the-middle HTTP
    proxy for penetration testers and software developers.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to DNS Rebinding. The
    `mitmweb` interface did not include protection against DNS rebinding.
    This could be exploited by a malicious website to either access the
    sniffed data or run arbitrary Python scripts on the filesystem by
    setting the scripts config option.

  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [mitmproxy][1] is a interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy with
    a console interface for HTTP/1, HTTP/2, and WebSockets.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The command generated by `export.clip curl @focus` or `export.file curl
    @Focus /path/to/file` is not properly escaped so it can contain a
    malicious command.
