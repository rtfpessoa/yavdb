  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). The `/login` and `/change` endpoints can return the
    authenticated user\'s authentication token in response to a GET request.
    Since GET requests aren\'t protected with a CSRF token, this could lead
    to a malicious 3rd party site acquiring the authentication token.
