  title: Out-of-bounds Read
  description: |
    [typed\_ast][1] is a Python 3 package that provides a Python 2.7 and
    Python 3 parser similar to the standard ast library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Out-of-bounds Read
    via `handle_keywordonly_args`. An attacker with the ability to cause a
    Python interpreter to parse Python source (but not necessarily execute
    it) may be able to crash the interpreter process.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Out-of-bounds Read.
    via `ast_for_arguments` out-of-bounds read. An attacker with the ability
    to cause a Python interpreter to parse Python source (but not
    necessarily execute it) may be able to crash the interpreter process.
    This could be a concern, for example, in a web-based service that parses
    (but does not execute) Python.
