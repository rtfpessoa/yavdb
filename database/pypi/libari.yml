  title: Malicious Package
  description: |
    [libari][1] is a malicious package. The package contains malicious code
    which will download a file from a C2 domain, save it as a hidden file
    named `.drv` in the userâ€™s home directory, and persist itself inside a
    system\'s `.bashrc` file to be run as a background process whenever an
    interactive non-login shell is created.
