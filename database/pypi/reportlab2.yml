  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [reportlab2][1] is a fork of reportlab with added AES-256 encryption
    (AESV3)

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). due to `toColor(eval(arg))` in `colors.py`, as
    demonstrated by a crafted XML document with `<span color="` followed by
    arbitrary Python code.
