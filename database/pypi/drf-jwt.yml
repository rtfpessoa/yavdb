  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [drf-jwt][1] is a JSON Web Token Authentication support package for
    Django REST Framework. *NOTE:* drf-jwt is a fork of
    jpadilla/django-rest-framework-jwt, which is unmaintained.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. It allows attackers with access to a notionally invalidated
    token to obtain a new, working token via the refresh endpoint, because
    the blacklist protection mechanism is incompatible with the
    token-refresh feature.
