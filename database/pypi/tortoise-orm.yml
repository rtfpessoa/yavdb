  title: SQL Injection
  description: |
    [tortoise-orm][1] is a familiar asyncio ORM for python, built with
    relations in mind.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL Injection when
    filtering or doing mass-updates on char/text fields. SQLite &amp;
    PostgreSQL are only affected when filtering with `contains`,
    `starts_with` , or `ends_with` filters (and their case-insensitive
    counterparts).
