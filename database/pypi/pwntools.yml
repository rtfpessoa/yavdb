  title: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')
  description: |
    [pwntools][1] is a CTF framework and exploit development library.
    Written in Python, it is designed for rapid prototyping and development,
    and intended to make exploit writing as simple as possible.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Control of
    Generation of Code (\'Code Injection\'). The shellcraft generator for
    affected versions of this module are vulnerable to Server-Side Template
    Injection (SSTI), which can lead to remote code execution.
