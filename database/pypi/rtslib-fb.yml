  title: Insecure Permissions
  description: |
    [rtslib-fb][1] is a Python library for configuring the Linux
    kernel-based multiprotocol SCSI target (LIO)

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure
    Permissions. It has weak permissions for `/etc/target/saveconfig.json`
    due to `shutil.copyfile` being used, instead of `shutil.copy`. That
    results in the file\'s permissions not being preserved.
