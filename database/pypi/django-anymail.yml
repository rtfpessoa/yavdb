  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [django-anymail][1] is a Django email integration for Mailgun, Mailjet,
    Postmark, SendGrid, SendinBlue, SparkPost and other transactional ESPs.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure
    in the `WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION` setting value. An attacker with access to
    error logs could fabricate email tracking events. If you have exposed
    your Django error reports, an attacker could discover your
    `NYMAIL_WEBHOOK` setting and use this to post fabricated or malicious
    Anymail tracking/inbound events to your app.
