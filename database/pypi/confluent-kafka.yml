  title: Buffer Overflow
  description: |
    [confluent-kafka][1] is a high-level Producer, Consumer and AdminClient
    compatible with all Apache KafkaTM broker

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. In
    the SASL SCRAM protocol handler if `sasl.username` and `sasl.password`
    contained characters that needed escaping, a buffer overflow and heap
    corruption occurs. This is protected, but too late, by an assertion.
