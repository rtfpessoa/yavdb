  title: Open Redirect
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect. A
    maliciously crafted link to a jupyter server could redirect the browser
    to a different website. All jupyter servers running without a `base_url`
    prefix are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted
    links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link
    to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a
    spoofed server on the public internet. This same vulnerability was
    patched in upstream notebook v5.7.8.
