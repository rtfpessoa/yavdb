  title: Authorization Bypass
  description: "[indy-node][1] is a package that implements server portion of a\ndistributed
    ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity.\n\nAffected versions of this
    package are vulnerable to Authorization\nBypass. There is lack of signature verification
    on a specific\ntransaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized\nalterations
    to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be\nwritten to the ledger
    if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed,\nregardless of sender. A malicious
    DID with no particular role can ask an\nupdate for another DID (but cannot modify
    its verkey or role). This is\nbad because:\n\n1.  Any DID can write a nym transaction
    to the ledger (i.e., any DID can\n    spam the ledger with nym transactions)\n\n2.
    \ Any DID can change any other DID\\'s alias\n\n3.  The update transaction modifies
    the ledger metadata associated with\n    a DID.\n    \n    ## Remediation   {#remediation}\n

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [indy-node][1] is a package that implements server portion of a
    distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). There is an Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in
    TAA handling code. The current primary can be crashed with a malformed
    transaction from a client, which leads to a view change. Repeated rapid
    view changes have the potential of bringing down the network.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
