  title: Insecure Permissions
  description: |
    [django-two-factor-auth][1] is a Complete Two-Factor Authentication for
    Django

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure
    Permissions. It is possible that if a site has been misconfigured and
    allows users to bypass django-two-factor-auth\'s login view (e.g. the
    admin site hasn\'t been configured correctly and admins can login
    without 2fa) and then disable that user\'s two-factor device(s). At this
    point an attacker could go set up a new two-factor and gain access to
    views protected by `otp_required`.This bug could also be exploited if
    the user has multiple sessions open before enabling two-factor auth. Any
    other session could then disable two-factor auth without having access
    to the device.
