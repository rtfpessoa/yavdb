  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [blazar-dashboard][1] is a horizon plugin for the Blazar Reservation
    Service for OpenStack.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. A user allowed to access the Blazar dashboard in Horizon may
    trigger code execution on the Horizon host as the user the Horizon
    service runs under (because the Python eval function is used). This may
    result in Horizon host unauthorized access and further compromise of the
    Horizon service. All setups using the Horizon dashboard with the
    blazar-dashboard plugin are affected.
