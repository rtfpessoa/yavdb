  title: Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  description: "[reportlab][1] is a Python library for generating PDFs and graphics.\n\nAffected
    versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-side Request\nForgery (SSRF)
    via `img` tags. In order to reduce risk, use\n`trustedSchemes` &amp; `trustedHosts`
    (see in Reportlab\\'s\ndocumentation)\n\nSteps to reproduce by Karan Bamal:\n\n1.
    \ Download and install the latest package of reportlab\n2.  Go to demos -&gt;
    odyssey -&gt; dodyssey\n3.  In the text file odyssey.txt that needs to be converted
    to pdf\n    inject `<img src=\"http://127.0.0.1:5000\" valign=\"top\"/>`\n4.  Create
    a nc listener `nc -lp 5000`\n5.  Run `python3 dodyssey.py`\n6.  You will get a
    hit on your nc showing we have successfully proceded\n    to send a server side
    request\n7.  `dodyssey.py` will show error since there is no img file on the url,\n
    \   but we are able to do SSRF\n    ## Remediation   {#remediation}\n    \n    There
    is no fixed version for `reportlab`.\n    ## References   {#references}\n\n* [Reportlab

  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [reportlab][1] is a Python library for generating PDFs and graphics.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE) due to `toColor(eval(arg))` in `colors.py`, as
    demonstrated by a crafted XML document with `<span color="` followed by
    arbitrary Python code.
