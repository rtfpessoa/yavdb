  title: Directory Traversal
  description: |
    [ansible][1] is a simple IT automation system.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal.
    It allows copying and overwriting files outside of the specified
    destination in the local ansible controller host, by not restricting an
    absolute path.



    [1]: https://pypi.org/project/ansible/
    \nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to
    access files and directories that are stored outside the intended
    folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and
    its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to
    access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including
    application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.

    Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two
    types:

    * **Information Disclosure**\: Allows the attacker to gain information
      about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on
      the system.

    `st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a
    [vulnerability of this type][1]. In our example, we will serve files
    from the `public` route.

    If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in
    turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.

        curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa

    **Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).

    * **Writing arbitrary files**\: Allows the attacker to create or replace
      existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as
      `Zip-Slip`.

    One way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds
    path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets
    concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the
    final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a
    configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code,
    the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite
    easily.

    The following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and
    one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in
    traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/`
    overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

        2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
        2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

    [ansible][1] is a simple IT automation system.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation. It didn\'t always succeed in changing a user\'s password.
    User\'s passwords sometimes failed to change without telling the user,
    The meaning of it is that old passwords might still be active when they
    should have been modified.

    [ansible][1] is a simple IT automation system.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information

    templates trigger and exposing them.

  description: |
    [ansible][1] is a simple IT automation system.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. Fields managing sensitive data should be set as such by
    no\_log feature. Some of these fields in GCP modules are not set
    properly. `service_account_contents()` which is a common class for all
    gcp modules does not set `no_log` to `True`. Any sensitive data managed
    by that function would be leak as an output when running ansible
    playbooks.

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [ansible][1] is a simple IT automation system.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. Filenames in the `nxos_file_copy` module are used to perform
    actions to copy files to a flash or bootflash on NXOS devices.
    `nxos_file_copy` uses the `remote_file parameter` to determine the files
    destination. Malicious code could craft the filename parameter to take
    advantage of this by performing an OS command injection.

  title: Arbitrary Code Injection
  description: |
    [ansible][1] is a simple IT automation system.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Injection. The `solaris_zone` module checks the status of the zone by
    executing an `os.system()` call and using the zone name as a parameter.
    A malicious user could provide a crafted zone name which allows commands
    to be executed into the server manipulating the module behaviour.

    [ansible][1] is a simple IT automation system.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information

    modules for Ansbile. This issue discloses the LDAP bind password to
    stdout or a log file if a playbook task is written using the `bind_pw`
    in the parameters field since nothing in the params field is evaluated
    for sensitive data.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command

    variable is passed to the pipe lookup, that variable could be overridden
    via facts, leading to arbitrary code execution.
