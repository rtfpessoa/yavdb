  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [`httplib2`][1] is a comprehensive HTTP client library.

    httplib2 0.7.2, 0.8, and earlier, after an initial connection is made,
    does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the
    subject\'s Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509
    certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL
    servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.

  title: CRLF Injection
  description: |
    [httplib2][1] is a small HTTP client library for Python.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to CRLF Injection. An
    attacker controlling an unescaped part of uri for
    `httplib2.Http.request()` could change request headers and body, send
    additional hidden requests to same server. This vulnerability impacts
    software that uses`httplib2` with `uri` constructed by string
    concatenation, as opposed to proper `urllib` building with escaping.
