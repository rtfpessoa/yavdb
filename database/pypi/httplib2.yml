  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [`httplib2`][1] is a comprehensive HTTP client library.

    httplib2 0.7.2, 0.8, and earlier, after an initial connection is made,
    does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the
    subject\'s Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509
    certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL
    servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
