  title: Race Condition
  description: |
    [webargs][1] is a python library for parsing and validating HTTP request
    objects, with built-in support for popular web frameworks, including
    Flask, Django, Bottle, Tornado, Pyramid, webapp2, Falcon, and aiohttp.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Race Condition. Json
    parsing uses a short-lived cache to store the parsed Json body. This
    cache is not thread-safe, meaning that incorrect Json payloads could
    have been parsed for concurrent requests.

  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [webargs][1] is a python library for parsing and validating HTTP request
    objects, with built-in support for popular web frameworks, including
    Flask, Django, Bottle, Tornado, Pyramid, webapp2, Falcon, and aiohttp.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). `Flaskparser.py` does not check that the `Content-Type`
    header is `application/json` when receiving JSON input. If the request
    body is valid JSON, it will accept it even if the content type is
    `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. This allows for JSON POST requests
    to be made across domains, leading to CSRF.
