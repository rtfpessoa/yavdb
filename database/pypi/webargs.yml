  title: Race Condition
  description: |
    [webargs][1] is a python library for parsing and validating HTTP request
    objects, with built-in support for popular web frameworks, including
    Flask, Django, Bottle, Tornado, Pyramid, webapp2, Falcon, and aiohttp.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Race Condition. Json
    parsing uses a short-lived cache to store the parsed Json body. This
    cache is not thread-safe, meaning that incorrect Json payloads could
    have been parsed for concurrent requests.
