  title: Timing Attack
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attack. It
    has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted
    ciphertext - both the bit length of the decrypted message as well as
    where the first unexpected byte lays.

  title: Improper Validation of Integrity Check
  description: |
    [tlslite-ng][1] is an open source python library that implements SSL and
    TLS cryptographic protocols.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Validation
    of Integrity Check. It can result in an attacker manipulating the TLS
    ciphertext which will not be detected by receiving tlslite-ng.
