  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [proxy.py][1] is a ⚡⚡⚡Fast, Lightweight, Pluggable, TLS interception
    capable proxy server focused on Network monitoring, controls &amp;
    Application development, testing, debugging.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. `before_upstream_connection` in `AuthPlugin` in
    `http/proxy/auth.py` accepts incorrect `Proxy-Authorization` header data
    because of a boolean confusion (and versus or).
