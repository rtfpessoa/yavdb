  title: HTTP Request Smuggling
  description: |
    [meinheld][1] is a High performance asynchronous Python WSGI Web Server

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Request
    Smuggling. HTTP pipelining issues and request smuggling attacks might be
    possible due to incorrect Content-Length and Transfer encoding header
    parsing.

    It is possible conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks by sending the
    `Content-Length` header twice. By manipulating the HTTP response the
    attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain
    sensitive information from requests other than their own. Furthermore,
    invalid Transfer Encoding headers were found to be parsed as valid which
    could be leveraged for CL:TE or TE:CL smuggling attacks.
