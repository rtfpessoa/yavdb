  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`github.com/golang/crypto/ssh`][1] are vulnerable
    to Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. The Go SSH library (x/crypto/ssh)
    by default does not verify host keys, facilitating man-in-the-middle
    attacks. Default behavior changed in commit [e4e2799][2] to require
    explicitly registering a hostkey verification mechanism.

  title: Improper Signature Verification
  description: |
    [golang.org/x/crypto/ssh][1] is a SSH client and server

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Signature
    Verification. An attacker can craft an `ssh-ed25519` or
    `sk-ssh-...@openssh.com` public key, such that the library will panic
    when trying to verify a signature with it. Clients can deliver such a
    public key and signature to any `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` server with a
    `PublicKeyCallback`, and servers can deliver them to any
    `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` client.
