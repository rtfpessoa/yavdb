  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |
    [k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/kubelet][1] is a package that contains the
    libraries that drive the Kubelet binary. The kubelet is responsible for
    node level pod management. It runs on each worker in the cluster.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). The Kubernetes kubelet component does not account for disk usage
    by a pod which writes to its own `/etc/hosts` file. The `/etc/hosts`
    file mounted in a pod by kubelet is not included by the kubelet eviction
    manager when calculating ephemeral storage usage by a pod. If a pod
    writes a large amount of data to the `/etc/hosts` file, it could fill
    the storage space of the node and cause the node to fail.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package][1]
