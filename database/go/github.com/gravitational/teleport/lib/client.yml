  title: Improper Validation
  description: |
    [github.com/gravitational/teleport/lib/client][1] is a privileged access
    management tool.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Validation.
    Host certificate validation was disabled for clusters where connections
    were terminated at the node, giving an attacker the ability to
    impersonate a Teleport node without detection when connecting through
    the Web UI.
