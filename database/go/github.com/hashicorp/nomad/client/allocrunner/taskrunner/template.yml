  title: Information Exposure Through Environmental Variables
  description: |
    [github.com/hashicorp/nomad/client/allocrunner/taskrunner/template][1]
    is a workload orchestrator that can deploy a mix of microservice, batch,
    containerized, and non-containerized applications

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure
    Through Environmental Variables. consul-template falls back to the host
    process environment if a variable isn\'t explicitly set in the
    configuration, meaning that `env-var` processes were made available to
    tasks.
