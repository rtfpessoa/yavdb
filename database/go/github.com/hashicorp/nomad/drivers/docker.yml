  title: Sandbox Bypass
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Sandbox Bypass. A
    vulnerability was discovered in Nomad and Nomad Enterprise (“Nomad”)
    such that an operator with job submission capabilities can mount the
    host file system of a client agent and subvert the default Docker file
    sandbox feature when not explicitly disabled, or when using a volume
    mount type.

    Nomad disables host filesystem access by default in 0.12.0 and above to
    prevent job operators from accessing the client filesystem used to
    persistently store any required data on disk. The Docker task driver
    provides a volume mount type which can be used to access the client host
    filesystem from within a container, but clients must be configured to
    enable mounting directories outside an allocation’s path to prevent
    abuse from unprivileged operators.
