    [github.com/hashicorp/consul/agent][1] is a distributed, highly
    available, and data center aware solution to connect and configure
    applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). Unbounded resource usage, triggered by the establishment of many
    unauthenticated HTTP or RPC connections, may generate excessive load
    and/or crash the server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code

    interface that can be accessed over the network and ACLs are disabled or
    an ACL token is compromised.

  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [github.com/hashicorp/consul/agent][1] is a distributed, highly
    available, and data center aware solution to connect and configure
    applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. Consul has two types of tokens, Global and Local. Local
    tokens are meant to only be resolvable and used within a single
    datacenter. Creation of local tokens is only allowed if either token
    replication is enabled in a secondary datacenter, or if the datacenter
    the token is scoped to is the primary. In a typical cluster we expect
    that either token replication is on in all datacenters or local tokens
    are not used at all.

    When token replication is not enabled in a secondary datacenter,
    attempts to use a local token created in the primary are successful for
    operations targeting that secondary datacenter. Thus what was meant to
    be scoped to a single datacenter is valid in other datacenters.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [github.com/hashicorp/consul/agent][1] is a distributed, highly
    available, and data center aware solution to connect and configure
    applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). The package included an HTTP API (introduced in 1.2.0) and DNS
    (introduced in 1.4.3) caching feature that was vulnerable to denial of
    service.



    [1]: https://www.consul.io/
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
