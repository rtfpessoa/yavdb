  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |-
    [github.com/hashicorp/consul/agent][1] is a distributed, highly
    available, and data center aware solution to connect and configure
    applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). Unbounded resource usage, triggered by the establishment of many
    unauthenticated HTTP or RPC connections, may generate excessive load
    and/or crash the server.

    [github.com/hashicorp/consul/agent][1] is a distributed, highly
    available, and data center aware solution to connect and configure
    applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure.

    Execution (RCE) via script checks, given that The API is available on an
    interface that can be accessed over the network and ACLs are disabled or
    an ACL token is compromised.
