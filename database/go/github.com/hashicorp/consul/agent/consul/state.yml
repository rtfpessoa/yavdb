  title: Insecure Permissions
  description: |
    [github.com/hashicorp/consul/agent/consul/state][1] is a tool for
    service discovery and configuration.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure
    Permissions. Consul fails to enforce changes to legacy ACL token rules
    due to non-propagation to secondary data centers.
