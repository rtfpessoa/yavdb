  title: Improper Validation
  description: |
    [github.com/hashicorp/vault-ssh-helper/helper][1] is a counterpart to
    HashiCorp Vault\'s SSH backend. It allows a machine to consume
    One-Time-Passwords (OTP) created by Vault servers by allowing them to be
    used as client authentication credentials at SSH connection time.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Validation.
    It incorrectly accepts Vault-issued SSH OTPs for the subnet in which a
    host\'s network interface was located, rather than the specific IP
    address assigned to that interface.
