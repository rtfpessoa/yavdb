  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/core][1] is a Package that implements the
    IpfsNode object and related methods.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. An attacker can generate ephemeral identities (Sybils) and
    leverage the IPFS connection management reputation system to poison
    other nodes\' routing tables, eclipsing the nodes that are the target of
    the attack from the rest of the network.
