  title: Cryptographic Issues
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cryptographic
    Issues. If a malicious attacker adds one of points of the subgroups of
    small order (i.e., non-identity torsion points) to a key image, up to 7
    double spends could be performed for each authentic spend on the
    cothority: this is now prevented by the Ge25519HasSmallOrder function.

    This happens because multiplying the sum of a torsion point by a
    multiple of 8 and a \"normal\" point will return the same point, because
    multiplying small subgroup points by 8 returns the identity element.
    Without the function Ge25519HasSmallOrder, signatures verify on
    malicious key images derived from the authentic ones.
