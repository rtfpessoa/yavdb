  title: Incorrect Calculation
  description: |
    [github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/core/vm][1] is a Package that
    implements the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Incorrect
    Calculation. It can be used to cause a chain-split where vulnerable
    nodes reject the canonical chain. Geth\'s pre-compiled `dataCopy` (at
    0x00...04) contract did a shallow copy on invocation. An attacker could
    deploy a contract that writes X to an EVM memory region R, then calls
    0x00..04 with R as an argument, then overwrites R to Y, and finally
    invokes the RETURNDATACOPY opcode.When this contract is invoked, a
    consensus-compliant node would push X on the EVM stack, whereas Geth
    would push Y.
