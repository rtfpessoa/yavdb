  title: Incorrect Calculation
  description: |
    [github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/consensus][1] is a package that
    implements different Ethereum consensus engines.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Incorrect
    Calculation. It could cause miners to erroneously calculate PoW in an
    upcoming epoch (estimated early January, 2021). This happened on the ETC
    chain on `2020-11-`06.

    *Note*\: This issue is relevant only for miners, non-mining nodes are
    unaffected.
