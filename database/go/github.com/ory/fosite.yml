  title: Improper Authentication
  description: |
    [github.com/ory/fosite][1] is an OAuth2 &amp; OpenID Connect framework
    for Go.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authentication. When using \"private\_key\_jwt\" authentication the
    uniqueness of the `jti` value is not checked. When using client
    authentication method \"private\_key\_jwt\", OpenId specification says
    the following about assertion `jti`\: \"A unique identifier for the
    token, which can be used to prevent reuse of the token. These tokens
    MUST only be used once, unless conditions for reuse were negotiated
    between the parties\". Hydra does not seem to check the uniqueness of
    this `jti` value.

  title: Open Redirect
  description: |
    [github.com/ory/fosite][1] is an OAuth2 &amp; OpenID Connect framework
    for Go.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect. An
    attacker can override the registered redirect URL by performing an OAuth
    flow and requesting direct URL that is to the loopback adapter.
    Attackers can provide both custom URL query parameters to their loopback
    redirect URL, as well as actually overriding the host of the registered
    redirect URL. These attacks are only applicable in scenarios where the
    attacker has access over the loopback interface.
