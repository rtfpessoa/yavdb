  title: Improper Authentication
  description: |
    [github.com/ory/fosite][1] is an OAuth2 &amp; OpenID Connect framework
    for Go.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authentication. When using \"private\_key\_jwt\" authentication the
    uniqueness of the `jti` value is not checked. When using client
    authentication method \"private\_key\_jwt\", OpenId specification says
    the following about assertion `jti`\: \"A unique identifier for the
    token, which can be used to prevent reuse of the token. These tokens
    MUST only be used once, unless conditions for reuse were negotiated
    between the parties\". Hydra does not seem to check the uniqueness of
    this `jti` value.
