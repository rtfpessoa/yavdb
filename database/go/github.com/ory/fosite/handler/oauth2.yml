  title: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
  description: |
    [github.com/ory/fosite/handler/oauth2][1] is an OAuth2 &amp; OpenID
    Connect framework for Go.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Handling of
    Exceptional Conditions. The `TokenRevocationHandler` ignores errors
    coming from the storage. This can lead to unexpected 200 status codes
    indicating successful revocation while the token is still valid. Whether
    an attacker can use this for her advantage depends on the ability to
    trigger errors in the store.
