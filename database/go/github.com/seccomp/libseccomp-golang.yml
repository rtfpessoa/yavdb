  title: Access Control Bypass
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Control
    Bypass. Earlier versions of libseccomp-golang incorrectly generates BPFs
    using `OR` boolean logic instead of AND. Due to this flaw, a process
    running under a restrictive `seccomp` filter that specified multiple
    `syscall` arguments could bypass intended access restrictions by
    specifying a single matching argument. Multiple `syscall` argument rules
    should be matched with `AND` logic.
