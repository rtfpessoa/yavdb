  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [github.com/tendermint/tendermint/p2p][1] is a p2p connection package
    part of tendermint.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). It does not limit the number of P2P connection requests. For each
    p2p connection, it allocates XXX bytes. Even though this memory is
    garbage collected once the connection is terminated (due to duplicate IP
    or reaching a maximum number of inbound peers), temporary memory spikes
    can lead to OOM (Out-Of-Memory) exceptions. Additionally, Tendermint
    does not reclaim `activeID` of a peer after it\'s removed in Mempool
    reactor. This does not happen all the time. It only happens when a
    connection fails (for any reason) before the Peer is created and added
    to all reactors. RemovePeer is therefore called before `AddPeer`, which
    leads to always growing memory (`activeIDs` map). The activeIDs map has
    a maximum size of 65535 and the node will panic if this map reaches the
    maximum. An attacker can create a lot of connection attempts (exploiting
    above denial of service), which ultimately will lead to the node
    panicking.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
