  title: Man in The Middle (MiTM)
  description: |
    [github.com/tendermint/tendermint/p2p/conn][1] is a p2p connection
    package part of tendermint.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man in The Middle
    (MiTM). The `MakeSecretConnection` function has a bug which allows a
    third party to MITM the connection and decrypt/modify data in a way
    which both sides think the long-term key of either side is the same.
    This is due to a lack of validation that the ephemeral or long-term keys
    are not of low-order.
