  title: Path Traversal
  description: |
    [github.com/slackhq/nebula][1] is a scalable overlay networking tool
    with a focus on performance, simplicity and security.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Path Traversal.
    Slack Nebula through 1.1.0 contains a relative path vulnerability that
    allows a low-privileged attacker to execute code in the context of the
    root user via tun\_darwin.go or tun\_windows.go. A user can also use
    Nebula to execute arbitrary code in the user\'s own context, e.g., for
    user-level persistence or to bypass security controls. NOTE: the vendor
    states that this \"requires a high degree of access and other
    preconditions that are tough to achieve.\"
