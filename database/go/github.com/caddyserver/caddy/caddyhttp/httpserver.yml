  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [github.com/caddyserver/caddy/caddyhttp/httpserver][1] is an
    implementation of an HTTP server on top of Caddy.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. It mishandles TLS client authentication, as demonstrated by an
    authentication bypass caused by the lack of the StrictHostMatching mode.
