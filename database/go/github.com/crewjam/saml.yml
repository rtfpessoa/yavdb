  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [github.com/crewjam/saml][1] is a package that contains a partial
    implementation of the SAML standard in golang. SAML is a standard for
    identity federation, i.e. either allowing a third party to authenticate
    your users or allowing third parties to rely on us to authenticate their
    users.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. It allows an attacker to bypass SAML Authentication.
