  title: Access Control Bypass
  description: |
    [github.com/rancher/rancher/pkg/controllers/user/rbac][1] is an open
    source project that provides a container management platform built for
    organizations that deploy containers in production. Rancher makes it
    easy to run Kubernetes everywhere, meet IT requirements, and empower
    DevOps teams.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Control
    Bypass. Project members have continued access to create, update, read,
    and delete namespaces in a project after they have been removed from it.
    Furthermore, any project member with access to the default namespace can
    mount the netes-default service account in a pod, and then use that pod
    to execute administrative privileged commands against the k8s cluster.
