  title: Open Redirect
  description: |
    [github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/cmd/frontend/auth][1] is an auth
    package for sourcegraph frontend.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect. The
    SourceGraph application has a vulnerable authentication workflow because
    of improper validation in the `SafeRedirectURL` method in
    `cmd/frontend/auth/redirect.go`, such as for the `//foo//example.com`
    substring.
