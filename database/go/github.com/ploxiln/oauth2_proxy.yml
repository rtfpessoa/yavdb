  title: Open Redirect
  description: |
    [github.com/ploxiln/oauth2\_proxy][1] is an a reverse proxy and static
    file server that provides authentication using Providers (Google,
    GitHub, and others) to validate accounts by email, domain or group.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect. As
    users can provide a redirect address for the proxy to send the
    authenticated user to at the end of the authentication flow. This is
    expected to be the original URL that the user was trying to access. This
    redirect URL is checked within the proxy and validated before
    redirecting the user to prevent malicious actors providing redirects to
    potentially harmful sites.
