  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [github.com/pion/dtls][1] is a DTLS 1.2 Server/Client implementation for
    Go.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). `handleIncomingPacket` in `conn.go` lacks a check for
    application data with epoch 0, which allows remote attackers to inject
    arbitrary unencrypted data after handshake completion.
