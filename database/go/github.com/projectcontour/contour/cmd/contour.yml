  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). A bad actor can shut down all instances of Envoy, essentially
    killing the entire ingress data plane. GET requests to /shutdown on port
    8090 of the Envoy pod initiate Envoy\'s shutdown procedure. The shutdown
    procedure includes flipping the readiness endpoint to false, which
    removes Envoy from the routing pool. When running Envoy (For example on
    the host network, pod spec `hostNetwork=true`), the shutdown manager\'s
    endpoint is accessible to anyone on the network that can reach the
    Kubernetes node that\'s running Envoy. There is no authentication in
    place that prevents a rogue actor on the network from shutting down
    Envoy via the shutdown manager endpoint. Successful exploitation of this
    issue will lead to bad actors shutting down all instances of Envoy,
    essentially killing the entire ingress data plane.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
