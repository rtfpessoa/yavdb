  title: Cryptographic Issues
  description: |
    [github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s][1] is a package that automates the
    deployment, provisioning, management, and orchestration of
    Elasticsearch, Kibana and APM Server on Kubernetes based on the operator
    pattern.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cryptographic
    Issues. A weak random number generator is used for generating passwords.
    If an attacker is able to determine when the current Elastic Stack
    cluster was deployed they may be able to more easily brute force the
    Elasticsearch credentials generated by ECK.
