  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    Affected version of [`github.com/opencontainers/libcontainer`][1] are
    vulnerable to Information Exposure. RunC allowed additional container
    processes via \'runc exec\' to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the container.
    This allows the main processes of the container, if running as root, to
    gain access to file-descriptors of these new processes during the
    initialization and can lead to container escapes or modification of runC
    state before the process is fully placed inside the container.

  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    Affected version of [`github.com/opencontainers/runc/libcontainer`][1]
    are vulnerable to Access Restriction Bypass. Docker Engine 1.12.2
    enabled ambient capabilities with misconfigured capability policies.
    This allowed malicious images to bypass user permissions to access files
    within the container filesystem or mounted volumes.

  title: Race Condition
  description: |
    [github.com/opencontainers/runc/libcontainer][1] is a package for a
    modern container runtime.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Race Condition. A
    race condition exists when checking for a dead process while waiting for
    the `exec fifo` to open.

  title: Race Condition
  description: |
    [github.com/opencontainers/runc/libcontainer][1] is a package for a
    modern container runtime.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Race Condition. an
    attacker who controls the container image for two containers that share
    a volume can race volume mounts during container initialization, by
    adding a symlink to the rootfs that points to a directory on the volume.
    The second container won\'t be able to see the actual mount, but it can
    race it by modifying the mount point on the volume.

    This can be exploited for a full container breakout by racing
    readonly/mask mounts, allowing writes to dangerous paths like
    `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`.
