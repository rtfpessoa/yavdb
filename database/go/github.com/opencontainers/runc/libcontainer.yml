  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    Affected version of [`github.com/opencontainers/libcontainer`][1] are
    vulnerable to Information Exposure. RunC allowed additional container
    processes via \'runc exec\' to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the container.
    This allows the main processes of the container, if running as root, to
    gain access to file-descriptors of these new processes during the
    initialization and can lead to container escapes or modification of runC
    state before the process is fully placed inside the container.

  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    Affected version of [`github.com/opencontainers/runc/libcontainer`][1]
    are vulnerable to Access Restriction Bypass. Docker Engine 1.12.2
    enabled ambient capabilities with misconfigured capability policies.
    This allowed malicious images to bypass user permissions to access files
    within the container filesystem or mounted volumes.

  title: Race Condition
  description: |
    [github.com/opencontainers/runc/libcontainer][1] is a package for a
    modern container runtime.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Race Condition. A
    race condition exists when checking for a dead process while waiting for
    the `exec fifo` to open.

  title: Race Condition
  description: |
    [github.com/opencontainers/runc/libcontainer][1] is a package for a
    modern container runtime.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Race Condition an
    attacker who controls the container image for two containers that share
    a volume can race volume mounts during container initialization, by
    adding a symlink to the rootfs that points to a directory on the volume.
    The second container won\'t be able to see the actual mount, but it can
    race it by modifying the mount point on the volume.

    This can be exploited for a full container breakout by racing
    readonly/mask mounts, allowing writes to dangerous paths like
    `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`.

  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [github.com/opencontainers/runc/libcontainer][1] is a package for a
    modern container runtime.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. `runc`\'s implementation of the `linux.resources.devices`
    list was a black-list by default. This means that users who created
    their own `config.json` objects and didn\'t prefix a deny-all rule
    (`{"allow": false, "permissions": "rwm"}` or equivalent) were not
    provided protection by the devices cgroup. This would allow malicious
    containers (with sufficient privileges) to create arbitrary device
    inodes (assuming they have CAP\_MKNOD) and operate on any device inodes
    they may have access to (assuming they have regular Unix DAC
    permissions).

    However, most (if not all) programs that make use of `runc` include this
    deny-all rule. This was most likely added before the specification
    mandated a white-list of devices, and the fact that all programs wrote
    their own deny-all rule obscured the existence of this bug for several
    years. In fact, even the specification\'s examples include a default
    deny-all rule! We therefore believe that while this is a security bug
    (and has been fixed as such), it was almost certainly not exploitable in
    the wild due to the inclusion of default deny-all rules by all known
    users of runc -- hence why this advisory has low severity.
