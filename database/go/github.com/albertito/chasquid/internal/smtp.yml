  title: Denial of Services (DoS)
  description: |
    [github.com/albertito/chasquid/internal/smtp][1] is a SMTP (email)
    server with a focus on simplicity, security, and ease of operation.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Services
    (DoS). in the smtp client package. There is no limit to the length of
    the server\'s replies, so a memory exhaustion is possible by issuing
    very long lines.
