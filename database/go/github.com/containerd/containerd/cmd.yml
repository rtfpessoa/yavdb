  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. Access controls for the shimâ€™s API socket verified that the
    connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise
    restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow
    malicious containers running in the same network namespace as the shim,
    with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause
    new processes to be run with elevated privileges.

  - "<1.2.0"
  - ">=1.3.0 <1.3.9"
