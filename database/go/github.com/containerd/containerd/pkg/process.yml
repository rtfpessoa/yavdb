  title: Improper Privilege Management
  description: |
    [github.com/containerd/containerd/pkg/process][1] is an open and
    reliable container runtime.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Privilege
    Management. Due to the usage of `unix.Kill` to kill a exec process, the
    pid in execProcess does not get deleted after a exec process has been
    stopped. Under certain conditions, it might be possible to for
    unprivileged process reuse generated pid and gain access to its
    privileges.
