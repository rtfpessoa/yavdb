  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [github.com/containerd/containerd/remotes/docker][1] is a docker
    container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness and
    portability.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. If a container image manifest in the OCI Image format or
    Docker Image V2 Schema 2 format includes a URL for the location of a
    specific image layer (otherwise known as a “foreign layer”), the default
    containerd resolver will follow that URL to attempt to download it.
