  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [github.com/containernetworking/plugins/pkg/ip][1] is a CNI network
    plugins, maintained by the containernetworking team.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM). A cluster configured to use an affected container networking
    implementation is susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. By
    sending “rogue” router advertisements, a malicious container can
    reconfigure the host to redirect part or all of the IPv6 traffic of the
    host to the attacker-controlled container. Even if there was no IPv6
    traffic before, if the DNS returns A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records,
    many HTTP libraries will try to connect via IPv6 first then fallback to
    IPv4, giving an opportunity to the attacker to respond.
