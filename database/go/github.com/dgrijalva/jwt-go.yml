  title: Insecure Defaults
  description: |
    Affected version of [`github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go`][1] could lead to
    authentication bypass vulnerability when used incorrectly. To address
    the issue, as of version `3.0.0`, key types are not compatible across
    signing methods.

    > Release notes: Dropped support for `[]byte` keys when using RSA
    > signing methods. This convenience feature could contribute to security
    > vulnerabilities involving mismatched key types with signing methods.

  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass if `m["aud"]` happens to be `[]string{}`, as allowed by the spec,
    the type assertion fails and the value of `aud` is `""`. This can cause
    audience verification to succeed even if the audiences being passed are
    incorrect if `required` is set to `false`.
