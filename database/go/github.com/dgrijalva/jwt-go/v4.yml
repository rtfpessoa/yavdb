  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go/v4][1] is a go implementation of JSON Web
    Tokens.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass if `m["aud"]` happens to be `[]string{}`, as allowed by the spec,
    the type assertion fails and the value of `aud` is `""`. This can cause
    audience verification to succeed even if the audiences being passed are
    incorrect if `required` is set to `false`.
