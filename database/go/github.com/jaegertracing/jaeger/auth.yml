  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/auth][1] is a distributed tracing
    platform.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. Sensitive information is written to a log file when the Kafka
    data store is used. This flaw allows an attacker with access to the
    container\'s log file to discover the Kafka credentials.
