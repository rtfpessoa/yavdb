  title: Path Traversal
  description: |
    [github.com/containers/buildah/imagebuildah][1] is a tool that
    facilitates building OCI images.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Path Traversal.
    During the image building process, a crafted tar file containing
    symlinks may lead `buildah` to overwrite any file which the running
    `uid` have write permissions, compromising confidentiality, integrity
    and possibly allowing code execution.
