  title: Open Redirect to an Untrusted Site
  description: |
    [github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy][1] is a reverse proxy that
    provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect to an
    Untrusted Site. Users can provide a redirect address for the proxy to
    send the authenticated user to at the end of the authentication flow.
    This is expected to be the original URL that the user was trying to
    access. This redirect URL is checked within the proxy and validated
    before redirecting the user to prevent malicious actors providing
    redirects to potentially harmful sites. However, by crafting a redirect
    URL with HTML encoded whitespace characters the validation could be
    bypassed and allow a redirect to any URL provided.
