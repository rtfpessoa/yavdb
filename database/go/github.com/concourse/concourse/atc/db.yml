  title: SQL Injection
  description: |
    [github.com/concourse/concourse/atc/db][1] is a container-based
    continuous thing-doer written in Go and Elm.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL Injection. An
    Concourse resource can craft a version identifier that can carry a SQL
    injection payload to the Concourse server, allowing the attacker to read
    privileged data.
