  title: Open Redirect
  description: |
    [github.com/concourse/concourse/skymarshal/skyserver][1] is a module of
    Concourse CI/CD automation system.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect. The
    login flow allows redirects to untrusted websites. **Note: Initial fix
    was released on v4.2.2, but an edge case fix was committed in 5.2.8.**

  description: |
    [github.com/concourse/concourse/skymarshal/skyserver][1] is a module of
    Concourse CI/CD automation system.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect. It
    allows redirects to untrusted websites in its login flow. A remote
    unauthenticated attacker could convince a user to click on a link using
    the OAuth redirect link with an untrusted website and gain access to
    that user\'s access token in Concourse. (This issue is similar to, but
    distinct from, CVE-2018-15798.)
