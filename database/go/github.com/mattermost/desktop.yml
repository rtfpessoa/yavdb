  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [github.com/mattermost/desktop][1] is a native desktop application for
    Mattermost running on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. The Same Origin Policy is mishandled during access-control
    decisions for web APIs which allows 3rd-party origins access to
    restricted web APIs.
