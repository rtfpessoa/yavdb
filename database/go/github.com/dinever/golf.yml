  title: Cryptographic Issues
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cryptographic
    Issues. `randomBytes` in `xsrf.go` uses `math.rand` to generate CSRF
    tokens. This is unsafe/insecure, and because it is seeded with
    `time.UnixNano`, generates predictable results that would allow an
    attacker to bypass CSRF protection.

  affected_package: github.com/dinever/golf
  vulnerable_versions:
  - "<0.3.0"
  severity: medium
  package_manager: go
  cwe:
  - CWE-310
