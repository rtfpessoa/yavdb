  title: Arbitrary File Overwrite
  description: "[github.com/thoughtworks/talisman/report][1] is a tool that installs
    a\nhook to your repository to ensure that potential secrets or sensitive\ninformation
    do not leave the developer\\'s workstation.\n\nAffected versions of this package
    are vulnerable to Arbitrary File\nOverwrite. When scanning a repository that includes
    a symlink under\n`talisman_reports/data/report.json`, talisman will overwrite
    the file\npointed by the symlink.\n\n### PoC by dcRUSTy   {#poc-by-dcrusty}\n\n*
    Execute `echo 123 > /tmp/data`\n* Scan a repo with `talisman_reports/data/report.json`
    symlinked to\n  `/tmp/data`\n* Run `talisman -s`\n* Observe content of `/tmp/data`\n
    \ ## Remediation   {#remediation}\n  \n  Upgrade `github.com/thoughtworks/talisman/report`
