  description: |
    [github.com/99designs/aws-vault/server][1] is a vault for securely
    storing and accessing AWS credentials in development environments.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to DNS Rebinding. With
    the aws-vault EC2 metadata service running, it\'s possible for an
    attacker controlling any web page the victim visits with javascript
    enabled to mount a DNS rebinding attack to grab short-lived credentials
    from the aws-vault server.
