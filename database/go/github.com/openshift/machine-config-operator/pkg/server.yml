  title: Insecure Permissions
  description: |
    [github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator/pkg/server][1] is an
    OpenShift 4 is an operator-focused platform, and the Machine Config
    operator extends that to the operating system itself, managing updates
    and configuration changes to essentially everything between the kernel
    and kubelet.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Permissions
    via the `/etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig` file. An attacker with access to a
    running container which mounts `/etc/kubernetes` or has local access to
    the node, may copy this `kubeconfig` file and attempt to add their own
    node to the OpenShift cluster.
