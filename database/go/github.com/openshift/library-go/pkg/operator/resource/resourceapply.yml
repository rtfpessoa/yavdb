  title: Sensitive Data Exposure
  description: |
    [github.com/openshift/library-go/pkg/operator/resource/resourceapply][1]
    is a package for creating helpers for going from apis and clients to
    useful runtime constructs.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Sensitive Data
    Exposure. Secret data can be written to pod logs when the log level in a
    given operator is set to `Debug` or higher. A low privileged user could
    read pod logs to discover secret material if the log level has already
    been modified in an operator by a privileged user.
