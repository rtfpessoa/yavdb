  title: Open Redirect
  description: |
    [github.com/openshift/elasticsearch-operator][1] is an Elasticsearch
    operator to run Elasticsearch cluster on top of Openshift and
    Kubernetes.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect. It
    does not validate the namespace where kibana logging resource is
    created. This makes it possible to replace the original
    openshift-logging console link to different one which can lead to an
    arbitrary URL redirection.
