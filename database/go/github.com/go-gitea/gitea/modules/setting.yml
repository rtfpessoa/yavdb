  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. If Gitea is installed as documented, the user running git
    hooks has limited permissions on the system but Gitea does not enforce
    this. Neither the documentation nor the UI contains a warning that
    explains the consequences of the git hook feature and the associated
    privilege.
