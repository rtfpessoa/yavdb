  title: Remote Code Execution
  description: |
    [github.com/go-gitea/gitea][1] is a self-hosted git service.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution due to mishandling of mirror repo URL settings, leading to
    remote code execution. This vulnerability is related to the
    `remoteAddress` function within the `models/repo_mirror.go` area not
    validating a repo URL.
