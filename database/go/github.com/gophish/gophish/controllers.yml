  title: Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  description: |
    [github.com/gophish/gophish/controllers][1] is a package middleware is
    responsible for the definition/â€‹implementation of middleware
    functionality.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-side Request
    Forgery (SSRF). It is possible to access the `Import Site` endpoint of
    the `Create Landing Page` area without cookie/API key authentication.
    Unauthenticated users who can access the admin portal can use it to
    perform server side request forgery attacks.

    Note: this is only really an issue if the admin interface is listening
    on anything other than 127.0.0.1, or if it is running on 127.0.0.1 on a
    multiuser machine accessed by non gophish admins.
