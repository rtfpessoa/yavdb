  title: Improper Authentication
  description: |
    [github.com/nats-io/nats-server/v2/server][1] is an A simple, secure and
    performant communications system for digital systems, services and
    devices.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authentication. The revocation check uses current time instead of jwt
    issue time.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [github.com/nats-io/nats-server/v2/server][1] is an A simple, secure and
    performant communications system for digital systems, services and
    devices.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). As a user, you can send a publish request which will publish a
    message to a subject, and all of the clients who are subscribed to the
    subject will receive the message. The problem is that the go runtime
    function `make` treats the capacity parameter as an unsigned int so
    instead of a negative number, it treats it like the number we sent it
    and then it tries to allocate an abnormal slice and panics.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
