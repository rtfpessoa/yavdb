  title: Insecure Permissions
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure
    Permissions. Certain directory paths are created (etcd data directory
    and the directory path when provided to automatically generate
    self-signed certificates for TLS connections with clients) with
    restricted access permissions (700) by using the os.MkdirAll. This
    function does not perform any permission checks when a given directory
    path exists already. A possible workaround is to ensure the directories
    have the desired permission (700).
