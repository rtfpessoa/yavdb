  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation. It is possible to have an entry index greater then the
    number of entries in the ReadAll method in `wal/wal.go`. This could
    cause issues when WAL entries are being read during consensus as an
    arbitrary etcd consensus participant could go down from a runtime panic
    when reading the entry.

  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation. A large slice causes panic in decodeRecord method. The size
    of a record is stored in the length field of a WAL file and no
    additional validation is done on this data. Therefore, it is possible to
    forge an extremely large frame size that can unintentionally panic at
    the expense of any RAFT participant trying to decode the WAL.
