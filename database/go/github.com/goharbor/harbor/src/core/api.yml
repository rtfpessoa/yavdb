  description: |
    [github.com/goharbor/harbor/src/core/api][1] is a cloud native registry
    project that stores, signs, and scans content.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. Non-administrator users (such as those created via
    self-registration) can list all usernames and user IDs by sending a GET
    request to /api/users/search with parameter \"username\" and value
    \"\_\", as follows:

    `curl -X GET "https://<host>/api/users/search?username=_" -H "accept:
    application/json" --user <user>:<password>`

  title: User Enumeration
  description: |
    [github.com/goharbor/harbor/src/core/api][1] is a cloud native registry
    project that stores, signs, and scans content.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to User Enumeration.
    The issue is present in the `/users` API endpoint. This endpoint is
    supposed to be restricted to administrators. This restriction is able to
    be bypassed and information can be obtained about registered users can
    be obtained via the \"search\" functionality.
