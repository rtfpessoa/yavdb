  title: Information Disclosure
  description: |
    [github.com/binance-chain/tss-lib/ecdsa/keygen][1] is an ECDSA keygen
    module for tss-lib

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Disclosure. It is possible for a malicious actor to generate bad
    parameters `h1`,`h2` that are shared with other parties during keygen.
    This allowed such an actor to compromise signing rounds and potentially
    expose the private data of other parties.

    Existing save data for signing groups that have already completed keygen
    should be considered secure if the parties were trusted at the time of
    keygen. This vulnerability could only have been exploited when a
    malicious actor with prior knowledge of this vulnerability had
    participated in keygen.
