  title: Elliptic Curve Key Disclosure
  description: |
    Affected version of [`github.com/square/go-jose`][1] are vulnerable to
    Elliptic Curve Key Disclosure. go-jose before 1.0.4 suffers from an
    invalid curve attack for the ECDH-ES algorithm. When deriving a shared
    key using ECDH-ES for an encrypted message, go-jose neglected to check
    that the received public key on a message is on the same curve as the
    static private key of the receiver, thus making it vulnerable to an
    invalid curve attack.

  title: Signature Validation Bypass
  description: |
    Affected version of [`github.com/square/go-jose`][1] are vulnerable to
    Signature Validation Bypass. go-jose before 1.0.4 suffers from multiple
    signatures exploitation. The go-jose library supports messages with
    multiple signatures. However, when validating a signed message the API
    did not indicate which signature was valid, which could potentially lead
    to confusion. For example, users of the library might mistakenly read
    protected header values from an attached signature that was different
    from the one originally validated.
