  title: Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  description: |
    [concrete5/concrete5][1] is an open source CMS.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server Side Request
    Forgery (SSRF) via file \'Replace\' functionality. A malicious user is
    able to scan local network and able to enumerate open TCP ports. The
    root of this issue is that any user could use localhost IPs in order to
    take a file. In addition, different errors returning for success and
    fail requests, e.g. in case if TPC port is opened - server respond is
    following: `Unknown mime-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8` or A valid
    response status line was not found in the provided string.
