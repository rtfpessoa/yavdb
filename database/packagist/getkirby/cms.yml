  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. The admin panel may be accessed if hosted on a .dev domain. In
    order to protect new installations on public servers that don\'t have an
    admin account for the Panel yet, Kirby blocks account registration there
    by default. To be able to register the first Panel account on a public
    server, you have to enforce the installer via a config setting. This
    helps to push all users to the best practice of registering your first
    Panel account on your local machine and upload it together with the rest
    of the site. This installation block implementation still assumed that
    .dev domains are local domains in the vulnerable versions, which is no
    longer true. In the meantime, those domains became publicly available.
    This means that our installation block is no longer working as expected
    if you use a .dev domain for your Kirby site. Additionally the local
    installation check may also fail if your site is behind a reverse proxy.
    You are only affected if you use a .dev domain or your site is behind a
    reverse proxy and you have not yet registered your first Panel account
    on the public server and someone finds your site and tries to login at
    `yourdomain.dev/panel` before you register your first account.
