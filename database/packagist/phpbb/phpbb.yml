    [phpbb/phpbb][1] is a Forum Software application.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-side Request
    Forgery (SSRF). It allows checking for the existence of files and
    services on the local network of the host through the remote avatar
    upload function.

    [phpbb/phpbb][1] is a Forum Software application.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). It did not properly enforce form tokens on changing
    group avatars and handling pending group memberships which could have
    been used to trick users into carrying out unwanted actions.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [phpbb/phpbb][1] is a Forum Software application.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). The `Fulltext` native search component used within phpBB can be
    leveraged to cause long execution times, resulting in a Denial of
    Service attacks.

    Improper input validation in the Native Fulltext Search component of
    phpBB 3.2.5 and earlier allows an unauthenticated remote user to trigger
    a denial of service attack via the keywords URL parameter of
    `search.php`.

    Successful exploitation generates a slow SQL query which causes the
    database engine used by phpBB to consume all available CPU resources.
    Depending upon the database engine, users will also be completely unable
    to create or modify posts due to locks on the search index tables. The
    slowness of the query depends on the size of the `search_wordlist` and
    `search_wordmatch` tables.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
