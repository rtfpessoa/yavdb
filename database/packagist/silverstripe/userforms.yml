  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [silverstripe/userforms][1] is a module that provides a visual form
    builder for the SilverStripe CMS.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. Files uploaded via Forms to folders migrated from Silverstripe
    CMS 3.x may be put to the default \"/Uploads\" folder instead. Uploads
    performed via the CMS UI are not affected. This is a security issue
    because the default \"/Uploads\" folder is publicly accessible by
    default, which means unauthorised parties may access the uploaded files
    via HTTP by guessing the file name.
