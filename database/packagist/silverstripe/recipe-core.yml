  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). When malicious upload contents under allowed file
    extensions (for example HTML code in a TXT file) are stored as protected
    or draft files, the MIME detection can cause browsers to execute the
    file contents. Uploads stored as protected or draft files are allowed by
    default for authorised users only, but can also be enabled through
    custom logic as well as modules such as silverstripe/userforms. Sites
    using the previously optional silverstripe/mimevalidator module can
    configure MIME whitelists rather than extension whitelists, and hence
    prevent this issue. Sites on the Common Web Platform (CWP) use this
    module by default, and are not affected.
