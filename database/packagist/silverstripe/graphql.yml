  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [silverstripe/graphql][1] is a GraphQL server for SilverStripe models
    and other data.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). The GraphQL controller lacks any CSRF protection,
    meaning authenticated users can be forced or tricked into visiting a URL
    that would send a GET request to the affected web server that could
    mutate or destroy data without the user knowing.
