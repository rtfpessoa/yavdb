  title: Incorrect Access Control
  description: |
    [silverstripe/assets][1] is a asset module required component of
    SilverStripe Framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Incorrect Access
    Control. An permission issue was found within Silverstripe where using
    the Upload PHP API to upload files into a protected folder would set the
    file\'s visibility to public, rather than respecting its parent folder
    permissions.

  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [silverstripe/assets][1] is a asset module required component of
    SilverStripe Framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. Unauthenticated users can access files with restricted view
    permissions when embedded in content. This does not affect draft files,
    or files which aren\'t embedded in content.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [silverstripe/assets][1] is a asset module required component of
    SilverStripe Framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. Files uploaded via Forms to folders migrated from Silverstripe
    CMS 3.x may be put to the default \"/Uploads\" folder instead. Uploads
    performed via the CMS UI are not affected. This is a security issue
    because the default \"/Uploads\" folder is publicly accessible by
    default, which means unauthorised parties may access the uploaded files
    via HTTP by guessing the file name.
