  title: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  description: |
    [lightopenid/lightopenid][1] is an is a lightweight PHP5 library for
    easy OpenID authentication.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-Side Request
    Forgery (SSRF). Due to the unsafe usage of `curl_init` within the
    `openid.php` page, it is possible for an attacker to leverage OpenID 2.0
    assertion requests to possibly read server configuration, connect to
    internally exposed services.
