    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Injection. An attacker with user account could construct a specifically
    crafted string that will turn into a PHP object injection involving the
    `includes/shortcodes/class-wc-shortcode-products.php
    WC_Shortcode_Products::get_products()` use of cached queries within
    shortcodes.
