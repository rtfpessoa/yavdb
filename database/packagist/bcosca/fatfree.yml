  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [bcosca/fatfree][1] is an easy-to-use PHP micro-framework designed to
    help build dynamic and robust Web applications.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution if
    developers choose to pass user-controlled input (e.g., `$_REQUEST`,
    `$_GET`, or `$_POST`) to the framework\'s `Clear()` method.
