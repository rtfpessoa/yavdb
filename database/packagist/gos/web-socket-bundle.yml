  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [gos/web-socket-bundle][1] is a Symfony Web Socket Bundle.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure
    in
    `Gos\Bundle\WebSocketBundle\Server\App\Dispatcher\TopicDispatcher::onPublish()`.
    Messages are arbitrarily broadcasted to the related Topic if it does not
    succeed. The `dispatch()` method can be considered to not succeed if
    (depending on the version of the bundle) the callback defined on a topic
    route is misconfigured, a
    `Gos\Bundle\WebSocketBundle\Topic\TopicInterface` implementation is not
    found for the callback, a topic which also implements
    `Gos\Bundle\WebSocketBundle\Topic\SecuredTopicInterface` rejects the
    connection, or an Exception is unhandled. This can result in an
    unintended broadcast to the websocket server potentially with data that
    should be considered sensitive.
