  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: "[workerman/workerman][1] is an asynchronous event driven PHP framework\nfor
    easily building fast, scalable network applications.\n\nAffected versions of this
    package are vulnerable to Improper Input\nValidation. HTTP requests processed
    by `workerman` does not have\nadequate validation and as such, allows malformed
    Transfer-Encoding\nheaders.\n\nIn cases where `workerman` is used as an intermediate
    proxy such as\n`php-http-proxy` as part of a part of a chain of servers , it is\npossible
    for an attacker to leverage this behaviour to conduct HTTP\nRequest Smuggling.\n\n###
    PoC   {#poc}\n\n    Violation of RFC 7230 (Mishandling of Space)\n    \n    POST
    / HTTP/1.1\n    Host:localhost\n    Transfer-Encoding : chunked\n    Content-Length:
    4\n    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n    \n    \n    0\n\n\n\n[1]:
