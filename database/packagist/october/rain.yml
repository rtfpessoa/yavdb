  title: Reliance on Cookies without Validation
  description: |
    [october/rain][1] is an October Rain Library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Reliance on Cookies
    without Validation. Its encrypted cookie values were not tied to the
    name of the cookie the value belonged to. This meant that certain
    classes of attacks that took advantage of other theoretical
    vulnerabilities in user facing code (nothing exploitable in the core
    project itself) had a higher chance of succeeding.
