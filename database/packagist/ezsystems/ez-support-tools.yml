  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. A user having insufficient permissions is able to access the
    system information tabs if they type in the direct link (the link is not
    shown in the menu). The \"Setup / System info\" policy should be
    required to access it, but only backend login is actually required. This
    means any editor can see core system information, including the output
    from phpinfo(). The fix ensures that the access policy is correctly
    verified.
