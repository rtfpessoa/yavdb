  title: Denial of Service
  description: |
    [symfony/http-foundation][1] is a component defines an object-oriented
    layer for the HTTP specification.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service.
    When a `Response` does not contain a `Content-Type` header, Symfony can
    fallback to the format defined in the `Accept` header of the request,
    leading to a possible mismatch between the response\'s content and
    `Content-Type` header.

  title: Path Disclosure
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`symfony/http-foundation`][1] are vulnerable to
    Path Disclosure.

    On the Symfony 2.0.x version, there\'s a security issue that allows
    access to routes protected by a firewall even when the user is not
    logged in.

    Both the Routing component and the Security component uses the path
    returned by getPathInfo() to match a Request. The getPathInfo() returns
    a decoded path, but the Routing component
    (Symfony\\Component\\Routing\\Matcher\\UrlMatcher) decodes the path a
    second time; whereas the Security component,
    Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\RequestMatcher, does not

    Affected versions of [`symfony/http-foundation`][1] are vulnerable to
    Denial of Service (DoS).



    [1]: https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/http-foundation
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

    Affected versions of [`symfony/http-foundation`][1] are vulnerable to

    When an application uses an HTTP basic or digest authentication, Symfony
    does not parse the Authorization header properly, which could be
    exploited in some server setups (no exploits have been demonstrated
    though.)

    Affected versions of [`symfony/http-foundation`][1] are vulnerable to
    Man-in-the-Middle (MitM).

    The `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request` class provides a
    mechanism that ensures it does not trust HTTP header values coming from
    a \"non-trusted\" client. Unfortunately, it assumes that the remote
    address is always a trusted client if at least one trusted proxy is
    involved in the request; this allows a man-in-the-middle attack between
    the latest trusted proxy and the web server.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [symfony/http-foundation][1] is a http component for symphony.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS) attacks via the `PDOSessionHandler` class.

    **An application is vulnerable when:**

    * It uses `PDOSessionHandler` to store its sessions
    * And it uses MySQL as a backend for sessions managed by
      `PDOSessionHandler`
    * And the SQL mode does not contain `STRICT_ALL_TABLES` or
      `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES`.

    With this configuration, An attacker may conduct a denial of service by
    a well-crafted session, which leads to an infinite loop in the code.

  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [symfony/http-foundation][1] is a set of reusable PHP components.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. It maintained support for (legacy) IIS headers (`X-Original-URL`
    or `X-Rewrite-URL`) that allowed users to override the path in a request
    URL. As a result, it allowed a user to access one URL but have Symfony
    return a different one which can bypass restrictions on higher level
    caches and web servers.
