  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [symfony/http-client][1] is a Symfony HttpClient component.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). The `CachingHttpClient` class from the `HttpClient`
    Symfony component relies on the `HttpCache` class to handle requests.
    `HttpCache` uses internal headers like `X-Body-Eval` and `X-Body-File`
    to control the restoration of cached responses. The class was initially
    written with surrogate caching and ESI support in mind (all HTTP calls
    come from a trusted backend in that scenario). But when used by
    `CachingHttpClient` and if an attacker can control the response for a
    request being made by the `CachingHttpClient`, remote code execution is
    possible.
