  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |
    [pocketmine/pocketmine-mp][1] is a highly customisable, open source
    server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition written in PHP

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). Specially crafted `InventoryTransactionPacket`s sent by malicious
    clients were able to exploit the behaviour of
    `InventoryTransaction->findResultItem()` and cause it to take an
    abnormally long time to execute, causing an apparent server freeze.

    The affected code is intended to compact conflicting `InventoryActions`
    which are in the same `InventoryTransaction` by flattening them into a
    single action. When multiple pathways to a result existed, the
    complexity of this flattening became exponential. The problem was fixed
    by bailing when ambiguities are detected.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package][1]
