  title: Arbitrary Class Calling
  description: |
    [illuminate/cookie][1] is a Subtree split of the Illuminate Cookie
    component.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Class
    Calling. It disables all `serialization` / `unserialization` of cookie
    values. If an application\'s encryption key is in the hands of a
    malicious party, that party could craft cookie values using the
    encryption key and exploit vulnerabilities inherit to PHP object
    `serialization` / `unserialization`, such as calling arbitrary class
    methods within the application.
