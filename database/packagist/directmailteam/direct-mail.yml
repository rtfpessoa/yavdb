    [directmailteam/direct-mail][1] is an advanced Direct Mail/Newsletter
    mailer system with sophisticated options for personalization of emails
    including response statistics.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The extension is missing access check controls in the backend
    module, allowing a user (with restricted permissions to the `fe_users`
    table) to view and export data of frontend users who are subscribed to a
    newsletter.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [directmailteam/direct-mail][1] is an advanced Direct Mail/Newsletter
    mailer system with sophisticated options for personalization of emails
    including response statistics.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). The extension provides a functionality to log clicks on links in
    sent newsletters. This functionality does not limit the amount of log
    entries generated per link, so it is possible to use a valid link to
    fill the log table with a huge amount of records.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Open Redirect
  description: |
    [directmailteam/direct-mail][1] is an advanced Direct Mail/Newsletter
    mailer system with sophisticated options for personalization of emails
    including response statistics.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect. The
    extension does not properly implement “jumpUrl” handling, resulting in
    an Open Redirect for links sent in newsletters.

  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [directmailteam/direct-mail][1] is an advanced Direct Mail/Newsletter
    mailer system with sophisticated options for personalization of emails
    including response statistics.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. The extension fails to check if an authenticated backend user
    has access to newsletter subscriber tables (e.g. tt\_address, fe\_users)
    when using the CSV export function of the extension.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The extension fails to check if an authenticated backend user
    has access to pages with newsletter subscriber data when using the
    \"Special query\" feature. Exploiting this issue leads to information
    disclosure, since it is possible to use the CSV export function of the
    extension to export subscriber data from pages the backend user does not
    have access to.
