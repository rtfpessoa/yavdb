  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [directmailteam/direct-mail][1] is a advanced Direct Mail/Newsletter
    mailer system with sophisticated options for personalization of emails
    including response statistics.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The extension is missing access check controls in the backend
    module, allowing a user (with restricted permissions to the `fe_users`
    table) to view and export data of frontend users who are subscribed to a
    newsletter.
