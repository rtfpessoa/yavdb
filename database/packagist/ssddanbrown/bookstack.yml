  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [ssddanbrown/bookstack][1] is a BookStack documentation platform.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). A user could upload PHP files through image upload
    functions, which would allow them to execute code on the host system
    remotely. They would then have the permissions of the PHP process. This
    most impacts scenarios where non-trusted users are given permission to
    upload images in any area of the application.
