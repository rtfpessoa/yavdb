  title: Message Signature Bypass
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:openpgp][1] is a JavaScript implementation of the
    OpenPGP protocol.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Message Signature
    Bypass. OpenPGP defines several types of signatures with each type
    carrying a different semantic. Signatures are implemented as packets and
    each signature packet can contain subpackets.

    To indicate a message signature (e.g. a signed e-mail), the signature
    type “text” is used. The text signature packet verifies both its
    subpackets as well as the signed text.

    During verification of a message signature, OpenPGP.js does not verify
    that the signature is of type text. An attacker could therefore
    construct a message that, instead of a text signature, contains a
    signature of another type. As the input required for the verification
    process depends on the signature type, an attacker could use a signature
    with a type that only verifies its subpackets and does not require
    additional input.

    An attacker could construct a message that contains a valid “standalone”
    or “timestamp” signature packet signed by another person. OpenPGP.js
    would incorrectly assume this message to be signed by that person.

  title: Invalid Curve Attack
  description: |+
    [org.webjars.npm:openpgp][1] is a JavaScript implementation of the
    OpenPGP protocol.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Invalid Curve
    Attack. It allows an attacker, who is already able provide forged
    messages and gain feedback about whether decryption of these messages
    succeeded, to conduct an invalid curve attack in order to gain the
    victim\'s ECDH private key.



    [1]: https://openpgpjs.org
    \nElliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is used in key exchange
    protocolsdigital signatures, or for pseudo-random number generators. An
    elliptic curve in cryptography is a set of points over a finite field
    satisfying the following equation: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b. On the elliptic
    curve, a single operation can be executed: point addition.

    Elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) is an anonymous key exchange
    protocol that allows two parties (say, between a client and server) to
    establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.

    An Invalid Curve Attack occurs when a client forces the server to
    compute a common secret using a point outside of the defined curve. The
    server may disclose information, allowing a skilled attacker to
    calculate the secret key.

  title: Improper Authentication
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:openpgp][1] is a JavaScript implementation of the
    OpenPGP protocol.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authentication. OpenPGP signature subpackets contain information related
    to a signature (e.g. the creation timestamp). These subpackets may
    appear in a “hashed” and “unhashed” subpacket container. While the
    information in the hashed subpackets is signed, the unhashed subpackets
    are not cryptographically protected.

    An attacker could arbitrarily modify the contents of e.g. a key
    certification signature or revocation signature. As a result, the
    attacker could e.g. convince a victim to use an obsolete key for
    encryption.
