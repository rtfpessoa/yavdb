  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [`org.apache.karaf.jaas:org.apache.karaf.jaas.modules`][1] is a modern
    and polymorphic container.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure
    due to storing the password with the `interactive()` method. This method
    stores sensitive data in a String object, making it impossible to
    reliably purge the data from memory.

  title: LDAP injection
  description: |
    [org.apache.karaf.jaas:org.apache.karaf.jaas.modules][1] is a bundle
    that provides JAAS modules which can be used in Karaf (LDAP, JDBC, etc).

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to LDAP injection. It
    uses the`LDAPLoginModule` to authenticate users to a directory via LDAP.
    However, it is not encoding usernames properly and hence is vulnerable
    to LDAP injection attacks.

    While it appears that it not possible to exploit this vulnerability to
    allow an attacker to gain remote access, it allows an attacker to insert
    special characters into the search query step. Therefore, it can
    potentially be exploited as part of a Denial Of Service attack.

    \nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of
    bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent
    through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of
    bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for
    communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence
    (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part
    of popular protocols like *Remote Method Invocation (RMI)*, *Java
    Management Extension (JMX)*, *Java Messaging System (JMS)*, *Action
    Message Format (AMF)*, *Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState*, etc.

    *Deserialization of untrusted data* ([CWE-502][1]), is when the
    application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying
    that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control
    the state or the flow of the execution.

    Java deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest
    in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be
    abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library
    (Apache Commons Collection)][2]. These classes were used in zero-days
    affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.

    An attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a
    vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted
    data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the
    deserializer, getting the command executed.
