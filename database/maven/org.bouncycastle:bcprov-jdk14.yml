    [`org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk14`][1] The TLS implementation in the
    Bouncy Castle Java library before 1.48 and C# library before 1.8 does
    not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a noncompliant MAC
    check operation during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which
    allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and
    plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for
    crafted packets, a related issue to [CVE-2013-0169][2].

  title: Hash Collision
  description: |
    [`org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk14`][1] is a collection of APIs used in
    cryptography.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Hash Collision due to
    an error in the BKS version 1 keystore files.

    BKS is a keystore format, designed to function similarly to a Sun/Oracle
    JKS keystore. BKS files can contain public keys, private keys and
    certificates, and they rely on a password-based encryption to provide
    confidentiality and integrity protections to the keystore contents.

    The first version of a BKS file (aka `BKS-V1`) contained a design flaw
    when determining the key size used to protect the keystore data. It used
    the `SHA-1` hash function, which is 160 bits in length. In a
    `RFC7292-compliant` cryptographic algorithm, the MAC key size should be
    the same size as the hash function being used, meaning that the MAC key
    size should be 160 bits long for BKS files.

    However, Bouncy Castle BKS-V1 files uses only 16 bits for the MAC key
    size. Regardless of the complexity of the password, ghe BKS-V1 file will
    have merely 65,536 different encryption keys. An attacker may bruteforce
    this password in a matter of seconds by testing all 65K values.
