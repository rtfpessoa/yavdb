  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [org.apache.qpid:qpid-broker][1] makes messaging tools that speak AMQP
    and support many languages and platforms.

    In Apache Qpid Broker-J before 6.1.x before 6.1.5, the broker does not
    properly enforce a maximum frame size in AMQP 1.0 frames. A remote
    unauthenticated attacker could exploit this to cause the broker to
    exhaust all available memory and eventually terminate. Older AMQP
    protocols are not affected.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: HTTP Port Spoofing
  description: |
    [`org.apache.qpid:qpid-broker`][1] makes messaging tools that speak AMQP
    and support many languages and platforms.

    In Apache Qpid Broker-J 0.18 through 0.32, if the broker is configured
    with different authentication providers on different ports one of which
    is an HTTP port, then the broker can be tricked by a remote
    unauthenticated attacker connecting to the HTTP port into using an
    authentication provider that was configured on a different port. The
    attacker still needs valid credentials with the authentication provider
    on the spoofed port. This becomes an issue when the spoofed port has
    weaker authentication protection (e.g., anonymous access, default
    accounts) and is normally protected by firewall rules or similar which
    can be circumvented by this vulnerability. AMQP ports are not affected.
    Versions 6.0.0 and newer are not affected.
