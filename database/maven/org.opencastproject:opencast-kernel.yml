  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: |
    [org.opencastproject:opencast-kernel][1] is a free and open source
    solution for automated video capture and distribution at scale.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation due to disabling HTTPS hostname verification of its HTTP
    client used for a large portion of Opencast\'s HTTP requests.

  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [org.opencastproject:opencast-kernel][1] is a free and open source
    solution for automated video capture and distribution at scale.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. Users with the role `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` can use the
    user-utils endpoint to create new users not including the role
    `ROLE_ADMIN`. `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` is a non-standard role in Opencast
    which is referenced neither in the documentation nor in any code (except
    for tests) but only in the security configuration. From the name –
    implying an admin for a specific course – users would never expect that
    this role allows user creation.

  title: Improper Authorization
  description: |
    [org.opencastproject:opencast-kernel][1] is a free and open source
    solution for automated video capture and distribution at scale.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authorization. Enables a remember-me cookie based on a hash created from
    the username, password, and an additional system key. This means that an
    attacker getting access to a remember-me token for one server can get
    access to all servers which allow log-in using the same credentials
    without ever needing the credentials.

    Such an attack will usually not work on different installations –
    assuming that safe, unique passwords are used – but it is basically
    guaranteed to work to get access to all machines of one cluster if a
    token from one machine is compromised.

  title: Improper Authorization
  description: |
    [org.opencastproject:opencast-kernel][1] is a free and open source
    solution for automated video capture and distribution at scale.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authorization. Using a remember-me cookie with an arbitrary username can
    cause Opencast to assume proper authentication for that user even if the
    remember-me cookie was incorrect given that the attacked endpoint also
    allows anonymous access. This way, an attacker can, for example, fake a
    remember-me token, assume the identity of the global system
    administrator and request non-public content from the search service
    without ever providing any proper authentication.
