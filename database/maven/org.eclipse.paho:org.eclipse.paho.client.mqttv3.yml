  title: Insufficient Hostname Verification
  description: |
    [org.eclipse.paho:org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3][1] is an an MQTT
    client library written in Java for developing applications that run on
    the JVM or other Java compatible platforms such as Android.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficient
    Hostname Verification. When connecting to an MQTT server using TLS, the
    package was found to not check the results of setting a host name
    verifier. This could allow one MQTT server to impersonate another and
    provide the client library with incorrect information.
