  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [`org.apache.cxf:cxf-rt-rs-security-jose`][1] is an open source services
    framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing attacks
    because it does not use a constant time MAC signature comparison
    algorithm.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.apache.cxf:cxf-rt-rs-security-jose][1] is a services framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. Apache CXF ships with a OpenId Connect JWK Keys service, which
    allows a client to obtain the public keys in JWK format, which can then
    be used to verify the signature of tokens issued by the service.
    Typically, the service obtains the public key from a local keystore
    (JKS/PKCS12) by specifing the path of the keystore and the alias of the
    keystore entry. This case is not vulnerable. However it is also possible
    to obtain the keys from a JWK keystore file, by setting the
    configuration parameter `rs.security.keystore.type` to `jwk`. For this
    case all keys are returned in this file \"as is\", including all private
    key and secret key credentials. This is an obvious security risk if the
    user has configured the signature keystore file with private or secret
    key credentials.
