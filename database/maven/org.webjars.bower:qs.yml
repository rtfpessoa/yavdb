  title: Denial of Service (Event Loop Blocking)
  description: |
    [`qs`][1] is a querystring parser that supports nesting and arrays, with
    a depth limit.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). When parsing a string representing a deeply nested object, qs
    will block the event loop for long periods of time. Such a delay may
    hold up the server\'s resources, keeping it from processing other
    requests in the meantime, thus enabling a Denial-of-Service attack.

  title: Prototype Override Protection Bypass
  description: "[`qs`][1] is a querystring parser that supports nesting and arrays,
    with\na depth limit.\n\nBy default `qs` protects against attacks that attempt
    to overwrite an\nobject\\'s existing prototype properties, such as `toString()`,\n`hasOwnProperty()`,etc.\n\nFrom
    [`qs` documentation][2]\\:\n\n> By default parameters that would overwrite properties
    on the object\n> prototype are ignored, if you wish to keep the data from those
    fields\n> either use plainObjects as mentioned above, or set allowPrototypes to\n>
    true which will allow user input to overwrite those properties.\n> WARNING It
    is generally a bad idea to enable this option as it can\n> cause problems when
    attempting to use the properties that have been\n> overwritten. Always be careful
    with this option.\n\nOverwriting these properties can impact application logic,
    potentially\nallowing attackers to work around security controls, modify data,
    make\nthe application unstable and more.\n\nIn versions of the package affected
    by this vulnerability, it is\npossible to circumvent this protection and overwrite
    prototype\nproperties and functions by prefixing the name of the parameter with
    `[`\nor `]`. e.g. `qs.parse(\"]=toString\")` will return `{toString = true}`,\nas
    a result, calling `toString()` on the object will throw an exception.\n\n**Example:**\n\n
    \   qs.parse('toString=foo', { allowPrototypes: false })\n    // {}\n    \n    qs.parse(\"]=toString\",
    { allowPrototypes: false })\n    // {toString = true} <== prototype overwritten\n{:
    .language-js}\n\nFor more information, you can check out our [blog][3].\n\n\n\n[1]:

  title: Denial of Service (Memory Exhaustion)
  description: |+
    [org.webjars.bower:qs][1] is a querystring parser that supports nesting
    and arrays, with a depth limit.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (Memory Exhaustion). During parsing, the `qs` module may create a sparse
    area (an array where no elements are filled), and grow that array to the
    necessary size based on the indices used on it. An attacker can specify
    a high index value in a query string, thus making the server allocate a
    respectively big array. Truly large values can cause the server to run
    out of memory and cause it to crash - thus enabling a Denial-of-Service
    attack.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
