  title: Authorization Bypass
  description: |
    [io.prestosql:presto-main][1] is a distributed SQL query engine for big
    data.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authorization
    Bypass. Authenticated users can bypass authorization checks by directly
    accessing internal APIs. This impacts Presto server installations with
    secure internal communication configured. This does not affect
    installations that have not configured secure internal communication, as
    these installations are inherently insecure.
