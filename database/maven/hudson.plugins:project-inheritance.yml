  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [hudson.plugins:project-inheritance][1] is a Project Inheritance Plugin

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). A missing permission check in the HTTP endpoint
    triggering project creation allows users with `Overall/Read` permission
    to create these projects. Additionally, the HTTP endpoint receiving
    these requests did not require POST requests, this can be used to
    conduct a CSRF attack.

  title: Authorization Bypass
  description: |
    [hudson.plugins:project-inheritance][1] is a Project Inheritance Plugin

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authorization
    Bypass. Jenkins limits access to job configuration XML data
    (`config.xml`) to users with `Job/ExtendedRead` permission, typically
    implied by Job/Configure permission. Project Inheritance Plugin has
    several job inspection features, including the API URL
    `/job/…​/getConfigAsXML` for its Inheritance Project job type that does
    something similar.

    Affected versions do not check permissions for this new endpoint,
    granting access to job configuration XML data to every user with
    Job/Read permission.

    Additionally, the encrypted values of secrets stored in the job
    configuration are not redacted, as they would be by the `config.xml` API
    for users without Job/Configure permission.
