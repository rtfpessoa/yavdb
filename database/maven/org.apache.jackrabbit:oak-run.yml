  title: Insecure Temporary File Creation
  description: |
    [`org.apache.jackrabbit:oak-run`][1] The default configuration of
    javax.servlet.context.tempdir in Apache Commons FileUpload 1.0 through
    1.2.2 uses the /tmp directory for uploaded files, which allows local
    users to overwrite arbitrary files via an unspecified symlink attack.

  title: Arbitrary File Write
  description: |
    [`org.apache.jackrabbit:oak-run`][1] The DiskFileItem class in Apache
    Commons FileUpload, as used in Red Hat JBoss BRMS 5.3.1; JBoss Portal
    4.3 CP07, 5.2.2, and 6.0.0; and Red Hat JBoss Web Server 1.0.2 allows
    remote attackers to write to arbitrary files via a NULL byte in a file
    name in a serialized instance.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`org.apache.jackrabbit:oak-run`][1] MultipartStream.java in Apache
    Commons FileUpload before 1.3.1, as used in Apache Tomcat, JBoss Web,
    and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via a crafted Content-Type header
    that bypasses a loop\'s intended exit conditions.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
