  title: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
  description: |
    [com.elasticbox.jenkins-ci.plugins:elasticbox][1] is a ElasticBox CI
    Plug-in that launches, provisions, and manages Jenkins slaves on-demand
    in different cloud providers via ElasticBox.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. The plugin was found to store credentials
    unencrypted in the global config.xml configuration file on the Jenkins
    master where they can be viewed by users with access to the master file
    system.
