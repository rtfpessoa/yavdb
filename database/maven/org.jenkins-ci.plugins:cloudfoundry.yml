  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:cloudfoundry][1] can push apps to a Cloud
    Foundry platform at the end of a Jenkins build.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF) in `AbstractCloudFoundryPushDescriptor.java` that allows
    attackers with Overall/Read access to connect to an attacker-specified
    URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another
    method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
