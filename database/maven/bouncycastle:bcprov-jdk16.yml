  title: "[CVE-2013-1624]  Cryptographic Issues"
  description: The TLS implementation in the Bouncy Castle Java library before 1.48
    and C# library before 1.8 does not properly consider timing side-channel attacks
    on a noncompliant MAC check operation during the processing of malformed CBC padding,
    which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery
    attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a related
    issue to CVE-2013-0169.

  title: TLS Timing Attack
  description: |
    [`bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk16`][1] is a Java implementation of
    cryptographic algorithms. The package is organised so that it contains a
    light-weight API suitable for use in any environment (including the
    newly released J2ME) with the additional infrastructure to conform the
    algorithms to the JCE framework.

    The TLS implementation in the Bouncy Castle Java library before 1.48 and
    C# library before 1.8 does not properly consider timing side-channel
    attacks on a noncompliant MAC check operation during the processing of
    malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to conduct
    distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical
    analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a related issue to
    [CVE-2013-0169][2].
