  description: |
    [org.richfaces:richfaces-a4j][1] is an advanced UI component framework
    for easily integrating Ajax capabilities into business applications
    using JSF.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. An attacker may be able to inject arbitrary EL variable
    mapper, thus bypassing the mitigation for [CVE-2015-0279][2]
