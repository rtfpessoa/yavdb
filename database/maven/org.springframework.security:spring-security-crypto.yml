  title: Cryptographic Weakness
  description: |
    [org.springframework.security:spring-security-crypto][1] is a
    spring-security-crypto library for Spring Security.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cryptographic
    Weakness. Spring Security was found to be a fixed null initialization
    vector with CBC Mode in the implementation of the queryable text
    encryptor. A malicious user with access to the data that has been
    encrypted using such an encryptor may be able to derive the unencrypted
    values using a dictionary attack.
