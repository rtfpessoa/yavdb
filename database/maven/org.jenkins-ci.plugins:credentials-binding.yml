    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:credentials-binding][1] is a plugin that allows
    credentials to be bound to environment variables for use from
    miscellaneous build steps.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Credential Exposure.
    It allows specifying passwords and other secrets as environment
    variables, and will hide them from console output in builds.
