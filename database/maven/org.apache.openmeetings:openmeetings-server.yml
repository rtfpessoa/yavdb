  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). Attackers can use public NetTest web service of Apache
    OpenMeetings 4.0.0-5.0.0 to organize denial of service attack.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package][1]

  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [`org.apache.openmeetings:openmeetings-server`][1] is a module for
    OpenMeetings server assembly.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. Apache OpenMeetings 1.0.0 has an overly permissive
    crossdomain.xml file. This allows for flash content to be loaded from
    untrusted domains.

  title: SQL Injection
  description: |
    [`org.apache.openmeetings:openmeetings-server`][1] is a module for
    OpenMeetings server assembly.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL Injection.
    Apache OpenMeetings 1.0.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection. This allows
    authenticated users to modify the structure of the existing query and
    leak the structure of other queries being made by the application in the
    back-end.

    You can read more about `SQL Injection` on our [blog][2].

    [`org.apache.openmeetings:openmeetings-server`][1] is a module for

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). Apache OpenMeetings 1.0.0 doesn\'t check contents of files being
    uploaded. An attacker can cause a denial of service by uploading
    multiple large files to the server.

    [`org.apache.openmeetings:openmeetings-server`][1] is a module for

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitary File Read.
    The (1) FileService.importFileByInternalUserId and (2)
    FileService.importFile SOAP API methods in Apache OpenMeetings before
    3.1.1 improperly use the Java URL class without checking the specified
    protocol handler, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files
    by attempting to upload a file.

  title: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
  description: |+
    [`org.apache.openmeetings:openmeetings-server`][1] is a module for
    OpenMeetings server assembly.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to XML External Entity
    (XXE). Uploaded XML documents were not correctly validated in Apache
    OpenMeetings 3.1.0.



    [1]: https://openmeetings.apache.org
    \nXXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML
    input. XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding
    documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
    By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external
    entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing.
    When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and
    include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.

    Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive
    data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or
    relative paths in the system identifier.

    For example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element-
    username.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
           <username>John</username>
        </xml>
    {: .language-xml}

    An external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and
    present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or
    remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML
    entity that would fetch the content of `/etc/passwd` and display it to
    the user rendered by `username`.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
        <!DOCTYPE foo [
           <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
           <username>&xxe;</username>
        </xml>
    {: .language-xml}

    Other XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop
    returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading
    to Denial of Service.
