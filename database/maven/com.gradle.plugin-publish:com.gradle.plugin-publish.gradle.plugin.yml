  title: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File
  description: |
    [com.gradle.plugin-publish:com.gradle.plugin-publish.gradle.plugin][1]
    is a plugin that publishes plugins to the Gradle Plugin Portal.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insertion of
    Sensitive Information into Log File. When a plugin author publishes a
    Gradle plugin while running Gradle with the `--info` log level flag, the
    Gradle Logger logs an AWS pre-signed URL. If this build log is publicly
    visible (as it is in many popular public CI systems like TravisCI) this
    AWS pre-signed URL would allow a malicious actor to replace a recently
    uploaded plugin with their own. Malicious plugins can be potentially
    used to perform large scale supply chain attacks.

    An example of this sensitive data leakage can be found here:
