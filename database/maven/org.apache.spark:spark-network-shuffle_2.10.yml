  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [org.apache.spark:spark-network-shuffle\_2.10][1] is an open-source
    distributed general-purpose cluster-computing framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). A standalone resource manager\'s master may be
    configured to require authentication (`spark.authenticate`) via a shared
    secret. When enabled, however, a specially-crafted RPC to the master can
    succeed in starting an application\'s resources on the Spark cluster,
    even without the shared key. This can be leveraged to execute shell
    commands on the host machine. This does not affect Spark clusters using
    other resource managers (YARN, Mesos, etc).
