  title: Incorrect Default Permissions
  description: |
    [org.apache.activemq:artemis-core-client][1] is a High-performance,
    non-blocking architecture for the next generation of event-driven
    messaging applications.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Incorrect Default
    Permissions. A flaw was found in ActiveMQ Artemis management API where a
    user inadvertently stores passwords in plaintext in the Artemis shadow
    file (`etc/artemis-users.properties` file) when executing the
    `resetUsers` operation. A local attacker can use this flaw to read the
    contents of the Artemis shadow file.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [org.apache.activemq:artemis-core-client][1] is a High-performance,
    non-blocking architecture for the next generation of event-driven
    messaging applications.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). If an Apache Artemis broker is configured with discovery enabled
    (either UDP or JGroups), on receiving of a packet over a discovery
    endpoint, Apache Artemis will attempt to decode the packet and as part
    of it an encoded simple string. The first four bytes of the encoded
    simple string represent it\'s length. During the decoding process Apache
    Artemis will create a byte array of the same length. It is possible
    therefore to send a manipulated packet to Apache Artemis with a very
    large integer in the first four bytes of the simple string encoding.
    Upon receiving the packet the broker will attempt to allocate a byte
    array of this large size. This could result in heap memory exhaustion,
    full GC or in the worst case an unrecoverable OutOfMemoryError,
    resulting in loss of service.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
