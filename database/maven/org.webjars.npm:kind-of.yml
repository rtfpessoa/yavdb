  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:kind-of][1] is a package that gets the native type of a
    value.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. It leverages the built-in constructor of unsafe user-input to
    detect type information. However, a crafted payload can overwrite this
    built in attribute to manipulate the type detection result.
