  title: Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command
    Execution. Selection tasks Plugin implements a job parameter that
    dynamically generates possible values from the output of a program. The
    path to that program is specified as part of the parameter
    configuration.Selection tasks Plugin 1.0 and earlier executes this
    user-specified program on the Jenkins controller. This allows attackers
    with Job/Configure permission to execute an arbitrary system command on
    the Jenkins controller as the OS user that the Jenkins process is
    running as.
