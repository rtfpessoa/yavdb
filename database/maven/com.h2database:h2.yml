  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [com.h2database:h2][1] is a database engine

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). It provides a web console for managing the database,
    and by default it does not have a password set. The `CREATE ALIAS`
    function calls a java code, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary
    java code on projects running the h2 database.
