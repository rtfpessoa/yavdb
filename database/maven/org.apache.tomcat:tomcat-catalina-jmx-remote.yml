  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |+
    [org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-catalina-jmx-remote](None) is a maven plugin
    for Tomcat Remote JMX listener.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. When Tomcat is configured with the JMX Remote Lifecycle
    Listener, a local attacker without access to the Tomcat process or
    configuration files is able to manipulate the RMI registry to perform a
    man-in-the-middle attack to capture user names and passwords used to
    access the JMX interface. The attacker can then use these credentials to
    access the JMX interface and gain complete control over the Tomcat
    instance.

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-catalina-jmx-remote`][1] Affected versions of
    the package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. The
    `JmxRemoteLifecycleListener` was not updated to take account of
    Oracle\'s fix for CVE-2016-3427. Therefore, Tomcat installations using
    this listener remained vulnerable to a similar remote code execution
    vulnerability. This issue has been rated as important rather than
    critical due to the small number of installations using this listener
    and that it would be highly unusual for the JMX ports to be accessible
    to an attacker even when the listener is used.
