  title: Unsafe Dependancy Resolution
  description: |
    [org.eclipse.xtext:org.eclipse.xtext.maven.parent][1] is a framework for
    development of programming languages and domain-specific languages.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Unsafe Dependancy
    Resolution due to resolving dependencies over an insecure channel
    (http).

    If the build occurred over an insecure connection, a malicious user
    could have perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack during the build and alter
    the build artifacts that were produced. In case that any of these
    artifacts were compromised, any developers using these could be altered.

    **Note:** In order to validate that this artifact was not compromised,
    the maintainer would need to confirm that none of the artifacts
    published to the registry were not altered with. Until this happens, we
    can not guarantee that this artifact was not compromised even though the
    probability that this happened is low.

    We have chosen to alert on this issue when maintainers either decided to
    issue CVEs themselves, or in cases when maintainers decided against
    performing audits on there build to verify they had not been
    compromised.
