  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-coyote][1] is a Tomcat Connectors and HTTP
    parser.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). The `HTTP/2` implementation accepted streams with excessive
    numbers of `SETTINGS` frames and also permitted clients to keep streams
    open without reading/writing request/response data. By keeping streams
    open for requests that utilised the Servlet API\'s blocking I/O, clients
    were able to cause server-side threads to block eventually leading to
    thread exhaustion.



    [1]: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat-coyote
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Arbitrary file upload
  description: |
    [`org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-coyote`][1] The readObject method in the
    DiskFileItem class in Apache Tomcat and JBoss Web, as used in Red Hat
    JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss Portal
    6.0.0, allows remote attackers to write to arbitrary files via a NULL
    byte in a file name in a serialized instance, a similar issue to
    CVE-2013-2186. NOTE: this issue is reportedly disputed by the Apache
    Tomcat team, although Red Hat considers it a vulnerability. The dispute
    appears to regard whether it is the responsibility of applications to
    avoid providing untrusted data to be deserialized, or whether this class
    should inherently protect against this issue.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-coyote`][1]
    org/apache/tomcat/util/net/NioEndpoint.java in Apache Tomcat 6.x before
    6.0.36 and 7.x before 7.0.28, when the NIO connector is used in
    conjunction with sendfile and HTTPS, allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (infinite loop) by terminating the connection during
    the reading of a response.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-coyote`][1] It was discovered that a
    programming error in the processing of HTTPS requests in the Apache
    Tomcat servlet and JSP engine may result in denial of service via an
    infinite loop. The denial of service is easily achievable as a
    consequence of backporting a CVE-2016-6816 fix but not backporting the
    fix for Tomcat bug 57544. Distributions affected by this backporting
    issue include Debian (before 7.0.56-3+deb8u8 and 8.0.14-1+deb8u7 in
    jessie) and Ubuntu.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

    [org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-coyote][1] is a Tomcat Connectors and HTTP

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. A class in the`Http11InputBuffer.java` allows remote attackers
    to read data that was intended to be associated with a different
    request.

    [org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-coyote][1] is a Tomcat Connectors and HTTP
    parser.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS) due to not sending `WINDOW_UPDATE` messages for the connection
    window, clients were able to cause server-side threads to block
    eventually leading to thread exhaustion and a DoS.

    **Note:** This vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix for
    [CVE-2019-0199][2].
