  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`com.vmware.xenon:xenon-common`][1] are vulnerable
    to Authentication Bypass due to insufficient access controls for utility
    endpoints. Successful exploitation of this issue may result in
    information disclosure.

  title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  description: |
    [com.vmware.xenon:xenon-common][1] is a framework for writing small
    REST-based services.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of
    Untrusted Data. Successful exploitation of this issue may allow remote
    attackers to execute arbitrary code on the appliance.



    [1]: https://github.com/vmware/xenon
    \nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of
    bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent
    through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of
    bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for
    communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence
    (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part
    of popular protocols like *Remote Method Invocation (RMI)*, *Java
    Management Extension (JMX)*, *Java Messaging System (JMS)*, *Action
    Message Format (AMF)*, *Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState*, etc.

    *Deserialization of untrusted data* ([CWE-502][1]), is when the
    application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying
    that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control
    the state or the flow of the execution.

    Java deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest
    in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be
    abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library
    (Apache Commons Collection)][2]. These classes were used in zero-days
    affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.

    An attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a
    vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted
    data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the
    deserializer, getting the command executed.

    > Mad Gadget is one of the most pernicious vulnerabilities we’ve seen.

    > deserialization to send messages across the network, it would be like
