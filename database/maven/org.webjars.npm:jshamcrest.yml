  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
  description: |+
    jshamcrest\'s email address validator is vulnerable to regular
    expression denial of service ([ReDoS][1]) attack.



    [1]: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS
    \n\"The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of
    Service attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression
    implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work
    very slowly (exponentially related to input size). An attacker can then
    cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme
    situations and then hang for a very long time.\" \[1\]
