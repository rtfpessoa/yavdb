  title: Improper Authorization
  description: |
    [com.google.oauth-client:google-oauth-client][1] is a powerful and
    easy-to-use Java library for the OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2.0 authorization
    standards.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authorization. PKCE support is not implemented in accordance with the
    RFC for OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps. Without the use of PKCE, the
    authorization code returned by an authorization server is not enough to
    guarantee that the client that issued the initial authorization request
    is the one that will be authorized. An attacker is able to obtain the
    authorization code using a malicious app on the client-side and use it
    to gain authorization to the protected resource.
