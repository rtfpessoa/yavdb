    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. Attackers can obtain sensitive information about a private
    exponent because of Observable Differences in Behavior to Error Inputs.
    This occurs in `org.bouncycastle.crypto.encodings.OAEPEncoding`. Sending
    invalid `ciphertext` that decrypts to a short payload in the OAEP
    Decoder could result in the throwing of an early exception, potentially
    leaking some information about the private exponent of the RSA private
    key performing the encryption.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The primary engine class used for AES was `AESFastEngine`. Due
    to the highly table driven approach used in the algorithm it turns out
    that if the data channel on the CPU can be monitored the lookup table
    accesses are sufficient to leak information on the AES key being used.
    There was also a leak in `AESEngine` although it was substantially less.

    [1]: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22bcprov-jdk15on%22
    \nElliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is used in key exchange
    protocolsdigital signatures, or for pseudo-random number generators. An
    elliptic curve in cryptography is a set of points over a finite field
    satisfying the following equation: `y^2 = x^3 + ax + b`. On the elliptic
    curve, a single operation can be executed: point addition.

    Elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) is an anonymous key exchange
    protocol that allows two parties (say, between a client and server) to
    establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.

    An Invalid Curve Attack occurs when a client forces the server to
    compute a common secret using a point outside of the defined curve. The
    server may disclose information, allowing a skilled attacker to
    calculate the secret key.

  title: Hash Collision
  description: |
    [`org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk14`][1] is a collection of APIs used in
    cryptography.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Hash Collision due to
    an error in the BKS version 1 keystore files.

    BKS is a keystore format, designed to function similarly to a Sun/Oracle
    JKS keystore. BKS files can contain public keys, private keys and
    certificates, and they rely on a password-based encryption to provide
    confidentiality and integrity protections to the keystore contents.

    The first version of a BKS file (aka `BKS-V1`) contained a design flaw
    when determining the key size used to protect the keystore data. It used
    the `SHA-1` hash function, which is 160 bits in length. In a
    `RFC7292-compliant` cryptographic algorithm, the MAC key size should be
    the same size as the hash function being used, meaning that the MAC key
    size should be 160 bits long for BKS files.

    However, Bouncy Castle BKS-V1 files uses only 16 bits for the MAC key
    size. Regardless of the complexity of the password, ghe BKS-V1 file will
    have merely 65,536 different encryption keys. An attacker may bruteforce
    this password in a matter of seconds by testing all 65K values.

  title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  description: |
    [org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on][1] is a Java implementation of
    cryptographic algorithms.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of
    Untrusted Data via the `XMSS/XMSS^MT` private key deserialization. A
    handcrafted private key could include references to unexpected classes
    which would be picked up from the class path for the executing
    application.



    [1]: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk15on
    \nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of
    bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent
    through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of
    bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for
    communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence
    (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part
    of popular protocols like *Remote Method Invocation (RMI)*, *Java
    Management Extension (JMX)*, *Java Messaging System (JMS)*, *Action
    Message Format (AMF)*, *Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState*, etc.

    *Deserialization of untrusted data* ([CWE-502][1]), is when the
    application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying
    that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control
    the state or the flow of the execution.

    Java deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest
    in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be
    abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library
    (Apache Commons Collection)][2]. These classes were used in zero-days
    affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.

    An attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a
    vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted
    data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the
    deserializer, getting the command executed.

    > Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even
    > de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object
    > in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore
    > Java\'s strict type system will ensure you only get valid object
    > trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform
    > code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before
    > the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the
    > readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the
    > developer\'s control. By combining the readObject() methods of various
    > classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable
    > application an attacker can execute functions (including calling
    > Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).
