  description: |
    [org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on][1] is a Java implementation of
    cryptographic algorithms.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The primary engine class used for AES was `AESFastEngine`. Due
    to the highly table driven approach used in the algorithm it turns out
    that if the data channel on the CPU can be monitored the lookup table
    accesses are sufficient to leak information on the AES key being used.
    There was also a leak in `AESEngine` although it was substantially less.

  description: |+
    [`org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on`][1] Affected versions of this package
    are vulnerable to Invalid Curve Attacks.



    [1]: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22bcprov-jdk15on%22
    \nElliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is used in key exchange
    protocolsdigital signatures, or for pseudo-random number generators. An
    elliptic curve in cryptography is a set of points over a finite field
    satisfying the following equation: `y^2 = x^3 + ax + b`. On the elliptic
    curve, a single operation can be executed: point addition.

    Elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) is an anonymous key exchange
    protocol that allows two parties (say, between a client and server) to
    establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.

    An Invalid Curve Attack occurs when a client forces the server to
    compute a common secret using a point outside of the defined curve. The
    server may disclose information, allowing a skilled attacker to
    calculate the secret key.

  title: Hash Collision
  description: |
    [`org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk14`][1] is a collection of APIs used in
    cryptography.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Hash Collision due to
    an error in the BKS version 1 keystore files.

    BKS is a keystore format, designed to function similarly to a Sun/Oracle
    JKS keystore. BKS files can contain public keys, private keys and
    certificates, and they rely on a password-based encryption to provide
    confidentiality and integrity protections to the keystore contents.

    The first version of a BKS file (aka `BKS-V1`) contained a design flaw
    when determining the key size used to protect the keystore data. It used
    the `SHA-1` hash function, which is 160 bits in length. In a
    `RFC7292-compliant` cryptographic algorithm, the MAC key size should be
    the same size as the hash function being used, meaning that the MAC key
    size should be 160 bits long for BKS files.

    However, Bouncy Castle BKS-V1 files uses only 16 bits for the MAC key
    size. Regardless of the complexity of the password, ghe BKS-V1 file will
    have merely 65,536 different encryption keys. An attacker may bruteforce
    this password in a matter of seconds by testing all 65K values.

  description: |
    [org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on][1] is a Java implementation of

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficient

    signature on verification. It is possible to inject extra elements in
    the sequence making up the signature and still have it validate, which
    in some cases may allow the introduction of invisible data into a signed
    structure.

    [org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on][1] is a Java implementation of
    cryptographic algorithms.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Encryption.
    The `DHIES` implementation allowed the use of `ECB` mode. This mode is
    regarded as unsafe and support for it has been removed from the
    provider.

  title: Insecure Encryption
  description: |
    [BouncyCastle][1] is a Java implementation of cryptographic algorithms.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Encryption.
    It has a flaw in the Low-level interface to RSA key pair generator,
    specifically RSA Key Pairs generated in low-level API with added
    certainty may have less M-R tests than expected.

  title: Unexpected Code Execution
  description: |
    [org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on][1] is a Java implementation of
    cryptographic algorithms.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Unexpected Code
    Execution via the `XMSS/XMSS^MT` private key deserialization. A
    handcrafted private key could include references to unexpected classes
    which would be picked up from the class path for the executing
    application.
