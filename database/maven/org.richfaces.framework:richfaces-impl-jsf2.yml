  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [org.richfaces.framework:richfaces-impl-jsf2][1] is a Java Server Faces
    AJAX Framework Implementation.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. `ResourceBuilderImpl.java` in the RichFaces does not restrict
    the classes for which deserialization methods can be called, which
    allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted serialized
    data.

  title: 'JBoss RichFaces: Remote code execution due to insecure deserialization'
  description: 'A flaw was found in the way JBoss RichFaces handled deserialization.
    A  remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the execution of the  deserialization
    methods in any serializable class deployed on the server.  This could lead to
    a variety of security impacts depending on the  deserialization logic of these
    classes.
