  title: Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:fortify-on-demand-uploader][1] is a plugin for
    the Fortify on Demand service. An API key from the FoD service is
    necessary for this plugin to communicate with FoD.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-side Request
    Forgery (SSRF). An attacker with Overall/Read permission could initiate
    a connection to an attacker-specified server. The form validation
    methods now require `POST` requests and perform a permission check.

  title: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:fortify-on-demand-uploader][1] is a plugin for
    the Fortify on Demand service. An API key from the FoD service is
    necessary for this plugin to communicate with FoD.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. The plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job
    `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master where they can be viewed by
    users with `Extended Read` permission, or access to the master file
    system.

  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:fortify-on-demand-uploader][1] is a plugin for
    the Fortify on Demand service. An API key from the FoD service is
    necessary for this plugin to communicate with FoD.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). No permission checks are performed on a method
    implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access
    to Jenkins to connect to the globally configured Fortify on Demand
    endpoint using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through
    another method. Additionally, this form validation method does not
    require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
    vulnerability. This form validation method requires appropriate
    permission in Fortify on Demand Plugin 6.0.0.

  title: Improper Authorization
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:fortify-on-demand-uploader][1] is a plugin for
    the Fortify on Demand service. An API key from the FoD service is
    necessary for this plugin to communicate with FoD.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authorization. Fortify on Demand Plugin provides a list of applicable
    credentials IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one
    to use.This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing
    any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials
    IDs. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials
    using another vulnerability. An enumeration of credentials IDs in
    Fortify on Demand Plugin 6.0.1 now requires the appropriate permissions.
