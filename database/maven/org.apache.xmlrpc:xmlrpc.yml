  title: Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  description: |
    [`org.apache.xmlrpc:xmlrpc`][1] is a Java implementation of XML-RPC, a
    popular protocol that uses XML over HTTP to implement remote procedure
    calls.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Server Side Request
    Forgery (SSRF). Sending an XML with a `DOCTYPE` declaration that loads
    an external DTD, a malicious user can send a GET request to the host on
    behalf of a vulnerable `xml-rpc` endpoint.

  title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  description: |
    [`org.apache.xmlrpc:xmlrpc`][1] is a Java implementation of XML-RPC, a
    popular protocol that uses XML over HTTP to implement remote procedure
    calls.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Deserialization of
    Untrusted Data. By default `ws-xmlrpc` supports `java.io.Serializable`
    data types through `<ex:serializable>` element. An attacker can leverage
    this to call a method and pass a serialized Java object in that element.
    `ws-xmlrpc` will deserialize the malicious object without validation.



    [1]: https://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/
    \nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of
    bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent
    through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of
    bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for
    communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence
    (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part
    of popular protocols like *Remote Method Invocation (RMI)*, *Java
    Management Extension (JMX)*, *Java Messaging System (JMS)*, *Action
    Message Format (AMF)*, *Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState*, etc.

    *Deserialization of untrusted data* ([CWE-502][1]), is when the
    application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying
    that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control
    the state or the flow of the execution.

    Java deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest
    in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be
    abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library
    (Apache Commons Collection)][2]. These classes were used in zero-days
    affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.

    An attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a
    vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted
    data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the
    deserializer, getting the command executed.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`org.apache.xmlrpc:xmlrpc`][1] is a Java implementation of XML-RPC, a
    popular protocol that uses XML over HTTP to implement remote procedure
    calls.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). By default `ws-xmlrpc` supports `Content-Encoding` HTTP header.
    When sending `Content-Encoding: gzip` header, the body is not gzipped,
    and an error returns. An attacker may create a specially crafted
    compressed file and cause a Denial of Service attack, also known as
    `decompression bomb` attack.



    [1]: https://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  description: |
    [org.apache.xmlrpc:xmlrpc][1] is a Java implementation of XML-RPC, a
    popular protocol that uses XML over HTTP to implement remote procedure
    calls. Compared to SOAP, or JAX-RPC, it is stable, much simpler and
    easier to handle. Version 3 of Apache XML-RPC introduces several
    important vendor extensions over the original XML-RPC specification.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of
    Untrusted Data. A flaw was discovered where the XMLRPC client
    implementation performed deserialization of the server-side exception
    serialized in the `faultCause` attribute of XMLRPC error response
    messages. A malicious or compromised XMLRPC server could possibly use
    this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of an
    application using the Apache XMLRPC client library.
