  title: Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  description: |
    [`org.apache.xmlrpc:xmlrpc`][1] is a Java implementation of XML-RPC, a
    popular protocol that uses XML over HTTP to implement remote procedure
    calls.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Server Side Request
    Forgery (SSRF). Sending an XML with a `DOCTYPE` declaration that loads
    an external DTD, a malicious user can send a GET request to the host on
    behalf of a vulnerable `xml-rpc` endpoint.

  title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  description: "[`org.apache.xmlrpc:xmlrpc`][1] is a Java implementation of XML-RPC,
    a\npopular protocol that uses XML over HTTP to implement remote procedure\ncalls.\n\nAffected
    versions of the package are vulnerable to Deserialization of\nUntrusted Data.
    By default `ws-xmlrpc` supports `java.io.Serializable`\ndata types through `<ex:serializable>`
    element. An attacker can leverage\nthis to call a method and pass a serialized
    Java object in that element.\n`ws-xmlrpc` will deserialize the malicious object
    without validation.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/\n\\nSerialization
    is a process of converting an object into a sequence of\nbytes which can be persisted
    to a disk or database or can be sent\nthrough streams. The reverse process of
    creating object from sequence of\nbytes is called deserialization. Serialization
    is commonly used for\ncommunication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and
    persistence\n(store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral
    part\nof popular protocols like *Remote Method Invocation (RMI)*, *Java\nManagement
    Extension (JMX)*, *Java Messaging System (JMS)*, *Action\nMessage Format (AMF)*,
    *Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState*, etc.\n\n*Deserialization of untrusted data*
    ([CWE-502][1]), is when the\napplication deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently
    verifying\nthat the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control\nthe
    state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known
    for years. However, interest\nin the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes
    that could be\nabused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular
    library\n(Apache Commons Collection)][2]. These classes were used in zero-days\naffecting
    IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\nAn attacker just needs
    to identify a piece of software that has both a\nvulnerable class on its path,
    and performs deserialization on untrusted\ndata. Then all they need to do is send
    the payload into the\ndeserializer, getting the command executed.\n\n> Developers
    put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even\n> de-serialize objects
    pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object\n> in Java you typically cast
    it to an expected type, and therefore\n> Java\\'s strict type system will ensure
    you only get valid object\n> trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking
    happens, platform\n> code has already created and executed significant logic.
    So, before\n> the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the\n>
    readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the\n> developer\\'s
    control. By combining the readObject() methods of various\n> classes which are
    available on the classpath of the vulnerable\n> application an attacker can execute
    functions (including calling\n> Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n>

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`org.apache.xmlrpc:xmlrpc`][1] is a Java implementation of XML-RPC, a
    popular protocol that uses XML over HTTP to implement remote procedure
    calls.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). By default `ws-xmlrpc` supports `Content-Encoding` HTTP header.
    When sending `Content-Encoding: gzip` header, the body is not gzipped,
    and an error returns. An attacker may create a specially crafted
    compressed file and cause a Denial of Service attack, also known as
    `decompression bomb` attack.



    [1]: https://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
