  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:database][1] is a plugin that defines a common
    abstraction to connect to relational database.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). It does not perform a permission check in a method
    implementing form validation. This allows attackers with Overall/Read
    access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified database server
    using attacker-specified username and password. Additionally, this form
    validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a
    cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
