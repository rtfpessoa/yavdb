  title: "[CVE-2010-2076]  Improper Input Validation"
  description: Apache CXF 2.0.x before 2.0.13, 2.1.x before 2.1.10, and 2.2.x before
    2.2.9, as used in Apache ServiceMix, Apache Camel, Apache Chemistry, Apache jUDDI,
    Apache Geronimo, and other products, does not properly reject DTDs in SOAP messages,
    which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, send HTTP requests to intranet
    servers, or cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via a crafted
    DTD, as demonstrated by an entity declaration in a request to samples/wsdl_first_pure_xml,
    a similar issue to CVE-2010-1632.

  title: Insufficient constraints on Document Type Declarations (DTDs)
  description: |
    [org.apache.cxf:cxf-common-utilities][1] is a maven plugin for the
    Apache CXF Common Utilities.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficient
    constraints on Document Type Declarations (DTDs). Apache CXF as used in
    Apache ServiceMix, Apache Camel, Apache Chemistry, Apache jUDDI, Apache
    Geronimo, and other products, does not properly reject DTDs in SOAP
    messages, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, send
    HTTP requests to intranet servers, or cause a denial of service (CPU and
    memory consumption) via a crafted DTD, as demonstrated by an entity
    declaration in a request to `samples/wsdl_first_pure_xml`, a similar
    issue to `CVE-2010-1632`.
