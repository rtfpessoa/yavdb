  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |
    [org.webjars.bower:jquery-form][1] is a jQuery plugin that allows you to
    upgrade HTML forms to use AJAX.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS). The package does not sanitise AJAX responses before rendering
    them. Therefore, an attacker could potentially inject malicious HTML
    into the page.
