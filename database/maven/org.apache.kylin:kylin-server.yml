  description: |
    [org.apache.kylin:kylin-server][1] is an analytics Engine, contributed
    by eBay Inc., provides SQL interface and multi-dimensional analysis
    (OLAP) on Hadoop supporting extremely large datasets.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    It one more restful API which concatenates the API inputs into OS
    commands and then executes them on the server; while the reported API
    misses necessary input validation, which causes the hackers to have the
    possibility to execute OS command remotely.

    (OLAP) on Hadoop supporting extremely large datasets.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL Injection. It
    concatenates and executes a Hive SQL in Hive CLI or beeline when
    building a new segment; some part of the HQL is from system
    configurations, while the configuration can be overwritten by certain
    rest api, which makes SQL injection attack is possible.
