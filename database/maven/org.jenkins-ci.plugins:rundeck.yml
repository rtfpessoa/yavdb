  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:rundeck][1] is a Notifier that will talk to a
    RunDeck instance (via its HTTP API) to schedule a job execution on
    RunDeck after a successful build on Jenkins.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). It does not perform permission checks on a method
    implementing form validation. This allows users with `Overall/Read`
    access to Jenkins to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified
    server with attacker-specified username and password. In addition, the
    form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a
    CSRF vulnerability.
