  title: Cryptographic Issues
  description: |
    [org.bouncycastle:bcprov-ext-jdk15][1] is a Java implementation of
    cryptographic algorithms.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cryptographic
    Issues. The TLS implementation does not properly consider timing
    side-channel attacks on a noncompliant MAC check operation during the
    processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to
    conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via
    statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a related issue
    to [CVE-2013-0169][2].
