  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [auth0-lock][1] is an authentication broker that supports both social
    and enterprise identity providers, including Active Directory, LDAP,
    Google Apps, and Salesforce.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF) attacks if the Legacy Lock API flag is enabled.

    Once the user credentials are verified, an HTML form is rendered into
    the user’s browser. A JSON Web Token (JWT) is POSTed to the
    `/login/callback` endpoint, and it maintains state regarding the
    identity of the user. Due to the lack of session binding, this form post
    is susceptible to CSRF. An attacker with valid user credentials at an
    Auth0 tenant can use them to gain such a form, and then employ
    techniques such as social engineering or clickjacking to have a victim’s
    browser execute it.
