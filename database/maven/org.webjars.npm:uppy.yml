  title: Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:uppy][1] is a sleek, modular JavaScript file uploader
    that integrates seamlessly with any application.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server Side Request
    Forgery (SSRF). The `get` endpoint is using the function `downloadURL`
    that calls the url directly without any kind of sanitization or
    validation, allowing an attacker to extract information from any
    internal resource, or take control of any internal service.
