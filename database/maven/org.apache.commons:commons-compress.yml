  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [org.apache.commons:commons-compress][1] defines an API for working with
    compression and archive formats.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). A specially crafted ZIP archive could be used to cause an
    infinite loop inside extra field parser used by the `ZipFile` and
    `ZipArchiveInputStream` classes.



    [1]: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.commons/commons-compress
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

    [org.apache.commons:commons-compress][1] is a API for working with
    compression and archive formats.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). When reading a specially crafted ZIP archive, the read method
    might fail to return the correct `EOF` indication after the end of the
    stream has been reached. If it combined with a
    `java.io.InputStreamReader`, it can lead to an infinite stream, which
    can be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that
    use Compress\' zip package.

  title: Directory Traversal
  description: |
    [org.apache.commons:commons-compress][1] is a API for working with
    compression and archive formats.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal.
    The example Expander class has been vulnerable to a path traversal in
    the edge case that happens when the target directory has a sibling
    directory and the name of the target directory is a prefix of the
    sibling directory\'s name.
