  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [org.apache.maven.shared:maven-shared-utils][1] is a functional
    replacement for plexus-utils in Maven.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The `Commandline` class can emit double-quoted strings without proper
    escaping, allowing shell injection attacks. The `BourneShell` class
    should unconditionally single-quote emitted strings (including the name
    of the command itself being quoted), with `{{'"'"'}}` used for embedded
    single quotes, for maximum safety across shells implementing a superset
    of POSIX quoting rules.

    This is a similar issue to [`SNYK-JAVA-ORGCODEHAUSPLEXUS-31522`][2]
