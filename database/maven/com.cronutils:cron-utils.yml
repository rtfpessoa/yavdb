  title: Improper Control of Generation of Code
  description: |
    [com.cronutils:cron-utils][1] is a Java library to parse, migrate and
    validate crons as well as describe them in human readable language.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Control of
    Generation of Code. A template injection vulnerability is present in
    previous versions of cron-utils. This enables attackers to inject
    arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to unauthenticated Remote Code
    Execution (RCE) vulnerability. Only projects using the @Cron annotation
    to validate untrusted Cron expressions are affected.
