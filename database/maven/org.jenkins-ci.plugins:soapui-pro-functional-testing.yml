  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:soapui-pro-functional-testing][1] is a plugin
    used to run SoapUI Pro tests from Jenkins builds.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. It stores project passwords in job. While these passwords are
    stored encrypted on disk since SoapUI Pro Functional Testing Plugin 1.4,
    they are transmitted in plain text as part of the global configuration
    form by SoapUI Pro Functional Testing Plugin 1.5 and earlier. These
    passwords can be viewed by attackers with Extended Read permission. This
    only affects Jenkins before 2.236, including 2.235.x LTS, as Jenkins
    2.236 introduces a security hardening that transparently encrypts and
    decrypts data used for a Jenkins password form field.
