  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |+
    [org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-webapp](None) is a maven plugin for Jetty web
    application support.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. The system\'s temporary directory is shared between all
    users on that system. A collocated user can observe the process of
    creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and
    race to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory. If the
    attacker wins the race then they will have read and write permission to
    the subdirectory used to unpack web applications, including their
    WEB-INF/lib jar files and JSP files. If any code is ever executed out of
    this temporary directory, this can lead to a local privilege escalation
    vulnerability.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-webapp][1] is a lightweight highly scalable
    java based web server and servlet engine.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. When an intentionally bad query arrives that doesn\'t match a
    dynamic url-pattern, and is eventually handled by the DefaultServlet\'s
    static file serving, the bad characters can trigger a
    `java.nio.file.InvalidPathException` which includes the full path to the
    base resource directory that the `DefaultServlet and/or` webapp is
    using. If this `InvalidPathException` is then handled by the default
    Error Handler, the `InvalidPathException` message is included in the
    error response, revealing the full server path to the requesting system.
