  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:bson][1] is a BSON Parser for node and browser.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression
    Denial of Service (ReDoS). This can cause an impact of about 10 seconds
    matching time for data 50K characters long.

  title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:bson][1] is a BSON Parser for node and browser.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of
    Untrusted Data. It will ignore an unknown value for an object\'s
    `_bsotype`, leading to cases where an object is serialized as a document
    rather than the intended BSON type.

    \##Details: Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all
    aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate
    users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
