  title: Access Control Bypass
  description: |
    [org.apache.zookeeper:zookeeper][1] is a centralized service for
    maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed
    synchronization, and providing group services.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Control
    Bypass. ZooKeeper’s `getACL()` method doesn’t check any permission when
    retrieving the ACLs of the requested node and returns all information
    contained in the ACL `Id` field as plain text string. If Digest
    Authentication is in use, the unsalted hash value will be disclosed by
    the `getACL()` method for unauthenticated or unprivileged users.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [org.apache.zookeeper:zookeeper][1] is a centralized service for
    maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed
    synchronization, and providing group services.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). Four letter zookeeper commands (such as `wchp`/`wchc` ) are not
    properly handled, which leads to the server unable to serve legitimate
    client requests.



    [1]: http://zookeeper.apache.org/
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [org.apache.zookeeper:zookeeper][1] is an effort to develop and maintain
    an open-source server which enables highly reliable distributed
    coordination.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. No authentication/authorization is enforced when a server
    attempts to join a quorum, as a result an arbitrary end point could join
    the cluster and begin propagating counterfeit changes to the leader.
