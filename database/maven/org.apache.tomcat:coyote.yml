    6.0.0 through 6.0.27, and 7.0.0 beta does not properly handle an invalid

    denial of service (application outage) or obtain sensitive information

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`org.apache.tomcat:coyote`][1] Integer overflow in the parseChunkHeader
    function in
    java/org/apache/coyote/http11/filters/ChunkedInputFilter.java in Apache
    Tomcat before 6.0.40, 7.x before 7.0.53, and 8.x before 8.0.4 allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via
    a malformed chunk size in chunked transfer coding of a request during
    the streaming of data.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

    [`org.apache.tomcat:coyote`][1] Integer overflow in
    java/org/apache/tomcat/util/buf/Ascii.java in Apache Tomcat before
    6.0.40, 7.x before 7.0.53, and 8.x before 8.0.4, when operated behind a
    reverse proxy, allows remote attackers to conduct HTTP request smuggling
    attacks via a crafted Content-Length HTTP header.

    [`org.apache.tomcat:coyote`][1]

    Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.42, 7.x before 7.0.55, and 8.x before 8.0.9 does
    not properly handle attempts to continue reading data after an error has
    occurred, which allows remote attackers to conduct HTTP request
    smuggling attacks or cause a denial of service (resource consumption) by
    streaming data with malformed chunked transfer coding.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |+
    `org.apache.tomcat:coyote` is a maven plugin for Tomcat Connectors and
    HTTP parser.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid
    characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that
    also permitted the invalid characters but with a different
    interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating
    the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS
    attack and/or obtain sensitive information from requests other then
    their own.

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`org.apache.tomcat:coyote`][1] Affected versions of the package are
    vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. The JmxRemoteLifecycleListener
    was not updated to take account of Oracle\'s fix for CVE-2016-3427.
    Therefore, Tomcat installations using this listener remained vulnerable
    to a similar remote code execution vulnerability. This issue has been
    rated as important rather than critical due to the small number of
    installations using this listener and that it would be highly unusual
    for the JMX ports to be accessible to an attacker even when the listener
    is used.

  title: Information Disclosure
  description: |
    [`org.apache.tomcat:coyote`][1] A bug in the handling of the pipelined
    requests in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18, 8.5.0 to 8.5.12,
    8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.42, 7.0.0 to 7.0.76, and 6.0.0 to 6.0.52, when send
    file was used, results in the pipelined request being lost when send
    file processing of the previous request completed. This could result in
    responses appearing to be sent for the wrong request. For example, a
    user agent that sent requests A, B and C could see the correct response
    for request A, the response for request C for request B and no response
    for request C.
