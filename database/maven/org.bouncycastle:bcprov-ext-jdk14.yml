  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.bouncycastle:bcprov-ext-jdk14][1] is a Java implementation of
    cryptographic algorithms.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. Attackers can obtain sensitive information about a private
    exponent because of Observable Differences in Behavior to Error Inputs.
    This occurs in `org.bouncycastle.crypto.encodings.OAEPEncoding`. Sending
    invalid `ciphertext` that decrypts to a short payload in the OAEP
    Decoder could result in the throwing of an early exception, potentially
    leaking some information about the private exponent of the RSA private
    key performing the encryption.

  title: Cryptographic Issues
  description: |
    [org.bouncycastle:bcprov-ext-jdk14][1] is a Java implementation of
    cryptographic algorithms.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cryptographic
    Issues. The TLS implementation does not properly consider timing
    side-channel attacks on a noncompliant MAC check operation during the
    processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to
    conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via
    statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a related issue
    to [CVE-2013-0169][2].

  description: |
    [org.bouncycastle:bcprov-ext-jdk14][1] is a Java implementation of
    cryptographic algorithms.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cryptographic Issues
    as it does not validate a point is within the elliptic curve, which
    makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain private keys via a series
    of crafted elliptic curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) key exchanges, aka an
    \"invalid curve attack\".
