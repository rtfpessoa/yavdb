  title: Insecure Permissions
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure
    Permissions. It does not perform permission checks in methods
    implementing form validation. This allows attackers with Overall/Read
    permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in
    Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the
    credentials using another vulnerability.An enumeration of credentials
    IDs in Ansible Plugin 1.1 requires the appropriate permissions.
