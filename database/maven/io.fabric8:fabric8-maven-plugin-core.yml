  title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  description: |
    [io.fabric8:fabric8-maven-plugin-core][1] is an one-stop-shop for
    building and deploying Java applications for Docker, Kubernetes and
    OpenShift.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of
    Untrusted Data. When using a wildfly-swarm or thorntail custom
    configuration, a malicious YAML configuration file on the local machine
    executing the maven plug-in via `YamlUtil.java` could allow for
    deserialization of untrusted data resulting in arbitrary code execution.
    The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality
    and integrity as well as system availability.

    \nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of
    bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent
    through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of
    bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for
    communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence
    (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part
    of popular protocols like *Remote Method Invocation (RMI)*, *Java
    Management Extension (JMX)*, *Java Messaging System (JMS)*, *Action
    Message Format (AMF)*, *Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState*, etc.

    *Deserialization of untrusted data* ([CWE-502][1]), is when the
    application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying
    that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control
    the state or the flow of the execution.

    Java deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest
    in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be
    abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library
    (Apache Commons Collection)][2]. These classes were used in zero-days
    affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.

    An attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a
    vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted
    data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the
    deserializer, getting the command executed.
