  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). MongoDB Plugin 1.3 and earlier does not perform
    permission checks in methods implementing form validation.This allows
    attackers with Overall/Read permission to gain access to some metadata
    of any arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.Additionally, these
    form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a
    cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
