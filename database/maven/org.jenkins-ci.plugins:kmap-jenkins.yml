    publishing mobile applications to your Keivox KMAP Private Mobile App
    Store.

    with Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in Kmap Plugin allow SSRF
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:kmap-jenkins][1] is a Jenkins plugin for
    publishing mobile applications to your Keivox KMAP Private Mobile App
    Store.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to CSRF vulnerability
    and missing permission check in Kmap Plugin allow SSRF. A missing
    permission check in a form validation method allows users with
    Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test to an
    attacker-specified server with attacker-specified credentials. The form
    validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF
    vulnerability.
