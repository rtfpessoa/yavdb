  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`org.apache.cassandra:cassandra-all`][1] Affected versions of the
    package are vulnerable to Denial of Service via an infinite loop.



    [1]: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22cassandra-all%22
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [org.apache.cassandra:cassandra-all][1] is a free and open-source
    distributed wide column store NoSQL database management system designed
    to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. The default configuration would bind an unauthenticated
    `JMX/RMI` interface to all network interfaces, which allowed remote
    attackers to execute arbitrary Java code via an `RMI` request.

    **Note:** This issue is a regression of
    [CVE-2015-0225](SNYK-JAVA-ORGAPACHECASSANDRA-30007).

  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [org.apache.cassandra:cassandra-all][1] is a maven plugin for the Apache
    Cassandra Project. Which, develops a highly scalable second-generation
    distributed database, bringing together Dynamo\'s fully distributed
    design and Bigtable\'s ColumnFamily-based data model.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM). It is possible for a local attacker without access to the Apache
    Cassandra process or configuration files to manipulate the RMI registry
    to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and capture user names and
    passwords used to access the JMX interface. The attacker can then use
    these credentials to access the JMX interface and perform unauthorised
    operations. Users should also be aware of CVE-2019-2684, a JRE
    vulnerability that enables this issue to be exploited remotely.
