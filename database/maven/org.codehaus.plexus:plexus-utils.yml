  title: Directory Traversal
  description: |
    [`Codehaus Plexus`][1] is a collection of components used by Apache
    Maven.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal.



    [1]: https://codehaus-plexus.github.io/
    \nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to
    access files and directories that are stored outside the intended
    folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and
    its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to
    access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including
    application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.

    Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two
    types:

    * **Information Disclosure**\: Allows the attacker to gain information
      about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on
      the system.

    `st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a
    [vulnerability of this type][1]. In our example, we will serve files
    from the `public` route.

    If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in
    turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.

        curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa

    **Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).

    * **Writing arbitrary files**\: Allows the attacker to create or replace
      existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as
      `Zip-Slip`.

    One way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds
    path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets
    concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the
    final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a
    configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code,
    the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite
    easily.

    The following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and
    one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in
    traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/`
    overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

        2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
        2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

    [`Codehaus Plexus`][1] is a collection of components used by Apache

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Shell Command
    Injection. The Commandline class in plexus-utils does not correctly
    quote the contents of double-quoted strings.

  title: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
  description: |
    [org.codehaus.plexus:plexus-utils][1] is a collection of various utility
    classes to ease working with strings, files, command lines, XML and
    more.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to XML External Entity
    (XXE) Injection.
    `org.codehaus.plexus.util.xml.XmlWriterUtil#writeComment` fails to
    sanitize comments for a `-->` sequence. This means that text contained
    in the command string could be interpreted as XML and allow for XML
    injection.
