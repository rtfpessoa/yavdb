  title: "[CVE-2013-1624]  Cryptographic Issues"
  description: The TLS implementation in the Bouncy Castle Java library before 1.48
    and C# library before 1.8 does not properly consider timing side-channel attacks
    on a noncompliant MAC check operation during the processing of malformed CBC padding,
    which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery
    attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a related
    issue to CVE-2013-0169.

  title: TLS Timing Attack
  description: |
    [bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15][1] is a Java implementation of cryptographic
    algorithms.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to TLS Timing Attack.
    The TLS implementation does not properly consider timing side-channel
    attacks on a noncompliant MAC check operation during the processing of
    malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to conduct
    distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical
    analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a related issue to
    [CVE-2013-0169][2].
