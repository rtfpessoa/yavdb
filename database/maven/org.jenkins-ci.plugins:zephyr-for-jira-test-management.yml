  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:zephyr-for-jira-test-management][1] is a Jenkins
    plugin that integrates Jenkins and Zephyr for JIRA â€“ Test Management for
    JIRA Cloud and JIRA Server / Data Center deployments.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). No permission check is perfromed in a method
    implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access
    to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified host using
    attacker-specified username and password.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST
    requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
    vulnerability.
