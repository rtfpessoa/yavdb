  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:selenium][1] is a Jenkins selenium plugin.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). They have no CSRF protection for their HTTP endpoints.
    This allows attackers to perform the following actions:

    * Restart the Selenium Grid hub.
    * Delete or replace the plugin configuration.
    * Start, stop, or restart Selenium configurations on specific nodes.

    Through carefully chosen configuration parameters, these actions can
    result in OS command injection on the Jenkins master.
