  title: Insufficient constraints on Document Type Declarations (DTDs)
  description: |+
    `org.apache.cxf:cxf-bundle-jaxrs` is a maven plugin for Apache CXF
    JAX-RS Bundle Jar.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficient
    constraints on Document Type Declarations (DTDs). Apache CXF as used in
    Apache ServiceMix, Apache Camel, Apache Chemistry, Apache jUDDI, Apache
    Geronimo, and other products, does not properly reject DTDs in SOAP
    messages, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, send
    HTTP requests to intranet servers, or cause a denial of service (CPU and
    memory consumption) via a crafted DTD, as demonstrated by an entity
    declaration in a request to `samples/wsdl_first_pure_xml`, a similar
    issue to `CVE-2010-1632`.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    `org.apache.cxf:cxf-bundle-jaxrs` is a maven plugin for Apache CXF
    JAX-RS Bundle Jar.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). Allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
    consumption) via a large request with the Content-Type set to text/html
    to a SOAP endpoint, which triggers an error.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
