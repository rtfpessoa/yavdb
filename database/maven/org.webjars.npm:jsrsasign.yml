  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:jsrsasign][1] is a free pure JavaScript cryptographic
    library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attack.
    Practical recovery of the long-term private key generated by the library
    is possible under certain conditions. Leakage of a bit-length of the
    scalar during scalar multiplication is possible on an elliptic curve
    which might allow practical recovery of the long-term private key.

  title: Signature Bypass
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:jsrsasign][1] is a free pure JavaScript cryptographic
    library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Signature Bypass. It
    allows a malleability in ECDSA signatures by not checking overflows in
    the length of a sequence and \'0\' characters appended or prepended to
    an integer. The modified signatures are verified as valid. This could
    have a security-relevant impact if an application relied on a single
    canonical signature.

  title: Memory Corruption
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:jsrsasign][1] is a free pure JavaScript cryptographic
    library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Memory Corruption.
    Its RSA PKCS1 v1.5 decryption implementation does not detect ciphertext
    modification by prepending \'\\0\' bytes to ciphertexts (it decrypts
    modified ciphertexts without error). An attacker might prepend these
    bytes with the goal of triggering memory corruption issues.

  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:jsrsasign][1] is a free pure JavaScript cryptographic
    library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). Its RSASSA-PSS (RSA-PSS) implementation does not detect
    signature manipulation/modification by prepending \'\\0\' bytes to a
    signature (it accepts these modified signatures as valid). An attacker
    can abuse this behavior in an application by creating multiple valid
    signatures where only one signature should exist. Also, an attacker
    might prepend these bytes with the goal of triggering memory corruption
    issues.
