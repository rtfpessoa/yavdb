  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: "[org.webjars.bowergithub.highlightjs:highlight.js][1] is a syntax\nhighlighter
    written in JavaScript. It works in the browser as well as on\nthe server. It works
    with pretty much any markup, doesn’t depend on any\nframework, and has automatic
    language detection.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype
    Pollution.\nA malicious HTML code block can be crafted that will result in prototype\npollution
    of the base object\\'s prototype during highlighting. If you\nallow users to insert
    custom HTML code blocks into your page/app via\nparsing Markdown code blocks (or
    similar) and do not filter the language\nnames the user can provide you may be
    vulnerable.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/highlight.js\n\\nPrototype
    Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype\nPollution refers
    to the ability to inject properties into existing\nJavaScript language construct
    prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript\nallows all Object attributes to be altered,
    including their magical\nattributes such as `_proto_`, `constructor` and `prototype`.
    An attacker\nmanipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript\napplication
    object prototype of the base object by injecting other\nvalues. Properties on
    the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all\nthe JavaScript objects through
    the prototype chain. When that happens,\nthis leads to either denial of service
    by triggering JavaScript\nexceptions, or it tampers with the application source
    code to force the\ncode path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote
    code\nexecution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes
    occurs:\n\n* Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n\n* Property definition by path\n\n###
    Unsafe Object recursive merge   {#unsafe-object-recursive-merge}\n\nThe logic
    of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following\nhigh-level model:\n\n
    \   merge (target, source)\n    \n      foreach property of source\n    \n        if
    property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n    \n          merge(target[property],
    source[property])\n    \n        else\n    \n          target[property] = source[property]\n\n\n\nWhen
    the source object contains a property named `_proto_` defined with\n`Object.defineProperty()`
    , the condition that checks if the property\nexists and is an object on both the
    target and the source passes and the\nmerge recurses with the target, being the
    prototype of `Object` and the\nsource of `Object` as defined by the attacker.
    Properties are then\ncopied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are
    a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges,\nwhich occur when a recursive
    merge is conducted on an empty object:\n`merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek`
    are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive\nmerge attacks.\n\n### Property
    definition by path   {#property-definition-by-path}\n\nThere are a few JavaScript
    libraries that use an API to define property\nvalues on an object based on a given
    path. The function that is\ngenerally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object,
    path,\nvalue)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set
    this value\nto `_proto_.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype
    of the\nclass of the object.\n\n"

  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
  description: "[org.webjars.bowergithub.highlightjs:highlight.js][1] is a syntax\nhighlighter
    written in JavaScript. It works in the browser as well as on\nthe server. It works
    with pretty much any markup, doesn’t depend on any\nframework, and has automatic
    language detection.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular
    Expression\nDenial of Service (ReDoS) via Exponential and Polynomial catastrophic\nbacktracking
    in multiple language highlighting.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/highlight.js\n\\nDenial
    of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at\nmaking a system
    inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There\nare many types of DoS
    attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network\npipes to the system by generating
    a large volume of traffic from many\nmachines (a Distributed Denial of Service
    - DDoS - attack) to sending\ncrafted requests that cause a system to crash or
    take a disproportional\namount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial
    of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of\nService attack. Regular expressions
    are incredibly powerful, but they\naren\\'t very intuitive and can ultimately
    end up making it easy for\nattackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the
    following regular expression as an example:\n\n    regex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n{: .language-js}\n\nThis
    regular expression accomplishes the following:\n\n* `A` The string must start
    with the letter \\'A\\'\n* `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A
    with either the\n  letter \\'B\\' or some number of occurrences of the letter
    \\'C\\' (the\n  `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section\n
    \ states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n* `D` Finally,
    we ensure this section of the string ends with a \\'D\\'\n\nThe expression would
    match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD`\nand `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases,
    it doesn\\'t take very long for a regex engine to find a\nmatch:\n\n    $ time
    node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n    0.04s user
    0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n    \n    $ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n
    \   1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n{: .language-bash}\n\nThe entire
    process of testing it against a 30 characters long string\ntakes around ~52ms.
    But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly\ntwo seconds to complete the
    test, over ten times as long as it took to\ntest a valid string. The dramatic
    difference is due to the way regular\nexpressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex
    engines will work very similarly (with minor differences).\nThe engine will match
    the first possible way to accept the current\ncharacter and proceed to the next
    one. If it then fails to match the\nnext one, it will backtrack and see if there
    was another way to digest\nthe previous character. If it goes too far down the
    rabbit hole only to\nfind out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many
    characters\nhave multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps
    can\nbecome very large, resulting in what is known as *catastrophic\nbacktracking*.\n\nLet\\'s
    look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a\nshorter string: \\\"ACCCX\\\".
    While it seems fairly straightforward, there\nare still four different ways that
    the engine could match those three\nC\\'s:\n\n1.  CCC\n2.  CC+C\n3.  C+CC\n4.
    \ C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of
    them\npotentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the\nother
    steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger][1] to\nsee the engine
    has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine\nthe string doesn\\'t
    match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string\njust
    continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C\\'s | Number of steps |\n|----------\n|
    ACCCX | 3 | 38 |\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71 |\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136 |\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX
    | 14 | 65,553 |\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C\\'s, the engine has to
    take over\n65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme\nsituations
    can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to\ninput size, as shown
    above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and\ncan cause the service to excessively
    consume CPU, resulting in a Denial\nof Service.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://regex101.com/debugger\n"
