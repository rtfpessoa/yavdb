  title: Cryptographic Issues
  description: |
    [com.google.crypto.tink:tink][1] is a multi-language, cross-platform,
    open source library that provides cryptographic APIs that are secure,
    easy to use correctly, and hard(er) to misuse.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cryptographic
    Issues. Under some circumstances it allowed attackers to change the key
    ID part of the ciphertext, resulting in the attacker creating a second
    ciphertext that will decrypt to the same plaintext. This can be a
    problem in particular in the case of encrypting with a deterministic
    AEAD with a single key, and relying on the fact that there is only a
    single valid ciphertext per plaintext.

    No loss of confidentiality or loss of plaintext integrity occurs due to
    this problem, only ciphertext integrity is compromised.
