  title: Improper Certificate Validation
  description: |
    [io.netty:netty-handler][1] is a library that provides an asynchronous
    event-driven network application framework and tools for rapid
    development of maintainable high performance and high scalability
    protocol servers and clients. In other words, Netty is a NIO client
    server framework which enables quick and easy development of network
    applications such as protocol servers and clients. It greatly simplifies
    and streamlines network programming such as TCP and UDP socket server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Certificate
    Validation. Certificate hostname validation is disabled by default in
    `Netty 4.1.x` which makes it potentially susceptible to
    Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`io.netty:netty-handler`][1] Affected versions of this package are
    vulnerable to infinite loop Denial of Service (DoS) attacks via a flaw
    in Netty\'s OpenSslEngine handling of renegotiation.

    **Note:** Netty is only vulnerable if renegotiation is enabled (It is a
    default setting).



    [1]: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22netty-handler%22
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [`io.netty:netty`][1] is a NIO client server framework which enables
    quick and easy development of network applications such as protocol
    servers and clients.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM) attacks. The SSLv3 protocol uses nondeterministic CBC padding,
    which makes it easier for Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attackers to obtain
    cleartext data via a padding-oracle attack. This is also known as the
    POODLE vulnerability.
