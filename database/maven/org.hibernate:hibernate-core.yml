  title: SQL Injection
  description: |
    [org.hibernate:hibernate-core][1] is a library providing
    Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) support to applications, libraries, and
    frameworks.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL Injection. A SQL
    injection in the implementation of the JPA Criteria API can permit
    unsanitized literals when a literal is used in the SELECT or GROUP BY
    parts of the query. This flaw could allow an attacker to access
    unauthorized information or possibly conduct further attacks.
