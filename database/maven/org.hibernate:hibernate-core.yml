  title: SQL Injection
  description: |
    [org.hibernate:hibernate-core][1] is a library providing
    Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) support to applications, libraries, and
    frameworks.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL Injection. A SQL
    injection in the implementation of the JPA Criteria API can permit
    unsanitized literals when a literal is used in the SQL comments of the
    query. This flaw could allow an attacker to access unauthorized
    information or possibly conduct further attacks. The highest threat from
    this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.
