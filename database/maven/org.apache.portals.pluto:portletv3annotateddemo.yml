    [org.apache.portals.pluto:portletv3annotateddemo][1] hosts the Java
    Portlet Specification Reference Implementation (RI) and Technology
    Compliance Kit (TCK)

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The Java Portlet Specification API jar file code provided by
    pluto could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information,
    caused by the failure to restrict access to resources located within the
    web application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain
    configuration data and other sensitive information.
