  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:cloudbees-jenkins-advisor][1] is a plugin that
    proactively notifies you of problems with your Jenkins-based
    environment.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). It does not perform permission checks in methods
    performing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access
    to send an email with fixed content to an attacker-specified recipient.
    Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST
    requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
