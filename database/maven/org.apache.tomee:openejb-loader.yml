  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [org.apache.tomee:openejb-loader][1] is a lightweight, yet powerful,
    JavaEE Application server with feature rich tooling.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. If configured to use the embedded ActiveMQ broker, and the
    broker config is misconfigured, a JMX port is opened on TCP port 1099,
    which does not include authentication. CVE-2020-11969 previously
    addressed the creation of the JMX management interface, however the
    incomplete fix did not cover this edge case.
