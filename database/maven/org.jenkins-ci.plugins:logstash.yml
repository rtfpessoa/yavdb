  title: Credential Exposure
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:logstash][1] is a Jenkins plugin that pushes
    logs and build data to a Logstash indexer such as Redis, RabbitMQ
    ElasticSearch, Logstash or Valo.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Credential Exposure.
    It transmits configured credentials in plain text as part of its global
    Jenkins configuration form, potentially resulting in their exposure.
