  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:artifactory][1] integrates Jenkins and
    Artifactory to publish, resolve, promote and release traceable build
    artifacts.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to User Enumeration
    attacks. A malicious user with Overall/Read access could enumerate
    credentials ID of credentials stored in Jenkins.

  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:artifactory][1] is a integrates Jenkins and
    Artifactory to publish, resolve, promote and release traceable build
    artifacts.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). Artifactory Plugin does not perform permission checks on
    a method implementing form validation.

    This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an
    attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained
    through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    `ReleaseAction#doSubmit`, `GradleReleaseApiAction#doStaging`,
    `MavenReleaseApiAction#doStaging`, and
    `UnifiedPromoteBuildAction#doSubmit` allows attackers to schedule a
    release build, perform release staging for Gradle and Maven projects,
    and promote previously staged builds, respectively.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST
    requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:artifactory][1] is a integrates Jenkins and
    Artifactory to publish, resolve, promote and release traceable build
    artifacts.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). Artifactory Plugin implements a number of API endpoints
    allowing users to trigger various actions related to releasing and
    promotion.

    These endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site
    request forgery vulnerability.

    Artifactory to publish, resolve, promote and release traceable build
    artifacts.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. The plugin stores its Artifactory server password
    unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master where
    it can be viewed by users with access to the master file system.
