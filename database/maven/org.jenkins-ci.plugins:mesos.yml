  title: Improper Authorization
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:mesos][1] is a Jenkins plugin to dynamically
    launch Jenkins slaves on a Mesos cluster. This plugin automatically
    spins up additional Jenkins slave(s) on Mesos so that jobs can be
    immediately scheduled

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authorization An attacker with `Overall/Read` could get access to
    escalate privileges by obtaining credentials IDs for credentials stored
    in Jenkins. The fixes add additional checks to make sure that the
    appropriate level of authorisation is required to perform administrator
    level tasks.
