  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:openshift-deployer][1] is a package that adds
    the ability to create gears and deploy applications to OpenShift.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). A missing permission check in a form validation method
    in OpenShift Deployer Plugin allows users with `Overall/Read` permission
    to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with
    attacker-specified credentials.
