  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [org.apache.thrift:libthrift][1] is a lightweight, language-independent
    software stack with an associated code generation mechanism for
    point-to-point RPC.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. A remote user had the ability to access files outside the set
    `webservers docroot` path.

  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [org.apache.thrift:libthrift][1] is a lightweight, language-independent
    software stack with an associated code generation mechanism for
    point-to-point RPC.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. It could bypass SASL negotiation in the
    `org.apache.thrift.transport.TSaslTransport` class. An assert used to
    determine if the SASL handshake had successfully completed could be
    disabled in production settings making the validation incomplete.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [org.apache.thrift:libthrift][1] is a lightweight, language-independent
    software stack with an associated code generation mechanism for
    point-to-point RPC.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). A server or client may run into an endless loop when fed with
    specific input data. Note: This issue was found to be partially fixed
    within version `0.11.0`, As such depending on the installed version it
    affects only certain language bindings.



    [1]: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.thrift/libthrift
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
