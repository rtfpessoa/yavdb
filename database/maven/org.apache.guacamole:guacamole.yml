  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.apache.guacamole:guacamole][1] is a clientless remote desktop
    gateway.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The package used a cookie for client-side storage of the
    user\'s session token. This cookie lacked the \"secure\" flag, which
    could allow an attacker eavesdropping on the network to intercept the
    user\'s session token if unencrypted HTTP requests are made to the same
    domain.

  title: Information Disclosure
  description: |
    [org.apache.guacamole:guacamole][1] is a clientless remote desktop
    gateway.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Disclosure. The package do not properly validate data received from RDP
    servers via static virtual channels. If a user connects to a malicious
    or compromised RDP server, specially-crafted PDUs could result in
    disclosure of information within the memory of the process handling the
    connection.

  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [org.apache.guacamole:guacamole][1] is a clientless remote desktop
    gateway.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). The package may mishandle pointers involved in
    processing data received via RDP static virtual channels. If a user
    connects to a malicious or compromised RDP server, a series of
    specially-crafted PDUs could result in memory corruption, possibly
    allowing arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of the
    running process.
