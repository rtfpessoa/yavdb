  title: Insecure Randomness
  description: |
    [org.apereo.cas:cas-server-support-simple-mfa][1] is an is package that
    allows Apereo CAS to act as a multifactor authentication provider on its
    own, issuing tokens and sending them to end-users via pre-defined
    communication channels such as email or text messages.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness.
    A insecure source of randomness is used to generate all of its random
    values as it relies upon apache commons lang3 `RandomStringUtils`. This
    could allow an attacker to possibly generate their own unique Ticket ID
    due to insufficient randomness.
