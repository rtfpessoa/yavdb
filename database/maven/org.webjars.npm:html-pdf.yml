  title: Arbitrary File Read
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:html-pdf][1] is a Html to pdf converter in nodejs.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read.
    The package fails to sanitize the HTML input, allowing attackers to
    exfiltrate server files by supplying malicious HTML code. XHR requests
    in the HTML code are executed by the server. Input with an XHR request
    such as `request.open("GET","file:///etc/passwd")` will result in a PDF
    document with the contents of `/etc/passwd`.
