  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.rundeck:rundeck][1] is a enable Self-Service Operations package
    which gives specific users access to your existing tools, services, and
    scripts.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. Authenticated users can craft a request that reveals execution
    data and logs and job details that they are not authorized to see.
    Depending on the configuration and the way that Rundeck is used, this
    could result in anything between a high severity risk, or a very low
    risk.

    An authenticated user could craft a request to:

    * View Executions and download execution logs without access to `read`
      or `view` the associated Job, or ad-hoc resource.
    * Get the list of running executions in a project, without Event `read`
      access, if they have `read` access to view the project.
    * View the Options definitions of a Job without access to view the Job.
    * View the definition of a workflow step of a Job without access to view
      the Job.
    * View the SCM diff of a modified Job definition if SCM is enabled,
      without Project `export` access level.
    * View the New User Profile Form for a different username, without User
      `admin` access. Note: they would not be allowed to create or modify a
      profile for a different user, or reveal any user profile information
      for a different user.
