  title: Information Exposure
  description: "[org.rundeck:rundeck][1] is an enable Self-Service Operations package\nwhich
    gives specific users access to your existing tools, services, and\nscripts.\n\nAffected
    versions of this package are vulnerable to Information\nExposure. Authenticated
    users can craft a request that reveals execution\ndata and logs and job details
    that they are not authorized to see.\nDepending on the configuration and the way
    that Rundeck is used, this\ncould result in anything between a high severity risk,
    or a very low\nrisk.\n\nAn authenticated user could craft a request to:\n\n* View
    Executions and download execution logs without access to `read`\n  or `view` the
    associated Job, or ad-hoc resource.\n* Get the list of running executions in a
    project, without Event `read`\n  access, if they have `read` access to view the
    project.\n* View the Options definitions of a Job without access to view the Job.\n*
    View the definition of a workflow step of a Job without access to view\n  the
    Job.\n* View the SCM diff of a modified Job definition if SCM is enabled,\n  without
    Project `export` access level.\n* View the New User Profile Form for a different
    username, without User\n  `admin` access. Note: they would not be allowed to create
    or modify a\n  profile for a different user, or reveal any user profile information\n
    \ for a different user.\n  ## Remediation   {#remediation}\n  \n  Upgrade `org.rundeck:rundeck`
    to version 3.2.6 or higher.\n  ## References   {#references}\n\n* [NVD][2]\n*
