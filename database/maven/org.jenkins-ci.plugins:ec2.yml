  title: Arbitrary Shell Execution
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:ec2][1] allows Jenkins to start slaves on EC2 or
    Eucalyptus on demand, and kill them as they get unused.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Shell
    Execution. It could configure an EC2 agent to run arbitrary shell
    commands on the master node whenever the agent was supposed to be
    launched. Configuration of these agents now requires the `Run Scripts`
    permission typically only granted to administrators.

    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:ec2][1] is a plugin for controlling agents on
    EC2 or Eucalyptus.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure
    due beginning of private keys being written to the Jenkins system log.

  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:ec2][1] is a plugin for controlling agents on
    EC2 or Eucalyptus.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). It does not perform permission checks in methods
    performing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access
    to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL within the AWS region
    using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another
    method. Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST
    requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:ec2][1] is a plugin for controlling agents on
    EC2 or Eucalyptus.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). The plugin does not require POST requests in several
    HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
    vulnerabilities. This allows an attacker to provision instances with an
    attacker-specified template ID.

    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:ec2][1] is a plugin for controlling agents on

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM). It does not use SSH host key validation when connecting to
    agents. This lack of validation could be abused using a
    man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

  title: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:ec2][1] is a plugin for controlling agents on
    EC2 or Eucalyptus.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. Provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to
    allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.This
    functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
    with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using
    another vulnerability.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM). Connects to Windows agents via `HTTPS.Amazon` unconditionally
    accepts self-signed HTTPS certificates and does not perform hostname
    validation when connecting to Windows agents. This lack of validation
    could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these
