  title: Arbitrary Shell Execution
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:ec2][1] allows Jenkins to start slaves on EC2 or
    Eucalyptus on demand, and kill them as they get unused.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Shell
    Execution. It could configure an EC2 agent to run arbitrary shell
    commands on the master node whenever the agent was supposed to be
    launched. Configuration of these agents now requires the `Run Scripts`
    permission typically only granted to administrators.
