  title: HTML reflection vulnerability in 500 error status handler (XSS)
  description: Certain IO errors containing the requested path can be echoed directly
    back to the user without a Content-Type header. In some cases, browsers' sniffing
    can result in the document being treated as HTML, allowing XSS. This is resolved
    by sending a Content-Type header of text/plain.

  title: Possible Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
  description: A recent vulnerability `HTML reflection vulnerability in 500 error
    status handler` was resolved for Firefox, but potentially not in all browsers.
    Previous versions of Internet Explorer have aggressively sniffed `text/plain`
    content as `text/html` despite the header, and it may be possible to provoke this
    behaviour in current versions if compatibility modes are enabled. Bugs have also
    resulted in this behaviour in other browsers in some contexts, as recently as
    iOS 6 Safari.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [org.webjars.npm:ecstatic][1] is a simple static file server middleware.
    Use it with a raw http server, express/connect or on the CLI.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). The vulnerability is caused by the combination of two bugs.
    First, the underlying V8 engine throws an exception when processing the
    specially crafted date, instead of stating the date is invalid as it
    should. Second, the ecstatic server does not handle the exception,
    triggering the crash.

    Upgrading `Ecstatic` will address the second issue and thus fix the
    vulnerability.



    [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ecstatic
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect. The

    requests that result in an `HTTP 301` redirect to any other domains.

    Use it with a raw http server, express/connect or on the CLI.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). The process of replacing null bytes in the url string is being
    done in a loop:

    `Find Null Bytes` --&gt; `If found remove Null Byte` --&gt; `Repeat`

    When no more Null Bytes found, the flow of the program continues.

    This method would work fine with a normal URL that should be relatively
    short, but a malicious user may craft a very long URL with a lot of Null
    Bytes.

    Use it with a raw http server, express/connect or on the CLI.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). It is possible to crash a server using the package due to the way
    URL params parsing is handled during redirect.

    ### PoC   {#poc}

        curl --path-as-is $(echo -e -n "http://127.0.0.1:8080/existing-dir-name?\x0cfoo")

    In the PoC the library is trying to redirect
    `/existing-dir-name?\x0cfoo` to `/existing-dir-name/?\x0cfoo` which
    cause `TypeError: The header content contains invalid characters` error
    because of `\x0c` symbol.
