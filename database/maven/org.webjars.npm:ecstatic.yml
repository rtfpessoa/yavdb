  title: HTML reflection vulnerability in 500 error status handler (XSS)
  description: Certain IO errors containing the requested path can be echoed directly
    back to the user without a Content-Type header. In some cases, browsers' sniffing
    can result in the document being treated as HTML, allowing XSS. This is resolved
    by sending a Content-Type header of text/plain.

  title: Possible Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
  description: A recent vulnerability `HTML reflection vulnerability in 500 error
    status handler` was resolved for Firefox, but potentially not in all browsers.
    Previous versions of Internet Explorer have aggressively sniffed `text/plain`
    content as `text/html` despite the header, and it may be possible to provoke this
    behaviour in current versions if compatibility modes are enabled. Bugs have also
    resulted in this behaviour in other browsers in some contexts, as recently as
    iOS 6 Safari.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [org.webjars.npm:ecstatic][1] is a simple static file server middleware.
    Use it with a raw http server, express/connect or on the CLI.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). The vulnerability is caused by the combination of two bugs.
    First, the underlying V8 engine throws an exception when processing the
    specially crafted date, instead of stating the date is invalid as it
    should. Second, the ecstatic server does not handle the exception,
    triggering the crash.

    Upgrading `Ecstatic` will address the second issue and thus fix the
    vulnerability.



    [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ecstatic
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

    [org.webjars.npm:ecstatic][1] is a simple static file server middleware.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect. The

    requests that result in an `HTTP 301` redirect to any other domains.

    are incredibly powerful, but they\naren\\'t very intuitive and can ultimately

    following regular expression as an example:\n\n    regex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n{: .language-js}\n\nThis
    regular expression accomplishes the following:\n\n* `A` The string must start

    with either the\n  letter \\'B\\' or some number of occurrences of the letter
    \\'C\\' (the\n  `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section\n
    \ states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n* `D` Finally,
    we ensure this section of the string ends with a \\'D\\'\n\nThe expression would
    match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD`\nand `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases,
    it doesn\\'t take very long for a regex engine to find a\nmatch:\n\n    $ time
    node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n    0.04s user
    0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n    \n    $ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n
    \   1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n{: .language-bash}\n\nThe entire
    process of testing it against a 30 characters long string\ntakes around ~52ms.
    But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly\ntwo seconds to complete the
    test, over ten times as long as it took to\ntest a valid string. The dramatic
    difference is due to the way regular\nexpressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex
    engines will work very similarly (with minor differences).\nThe engine will match
    the first possible way to accept the current\ncharacter and proceed to the next
    one. If it then fails to match the\nnext one, it will backtrack and see if there
    was another way to digest\nthe previous character. If it goes too far down the
    rabbit hole only to\nfind out the string doesnâ€™t match in the end, and if many
    characters\nhave multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps
    can\nbecome very large, resulting in what is known as *catastrophic\nbacktracking*.\n\nLet\\'s
    look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a\nshorter string: \\\"ACCCX\\\".
    While it seems fairly straightforward, there\nare still four different ways that
    the engine could match those three\nC\\'s:\n\n1.  CCC\n2.  CC+C\n3.  C+CC\n4.
    \ C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of

    steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger][1] to\nsee the engine
    has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine\nthe string doesn\\'t
    match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string\njust

    take over\n65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme\nsituations
    can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to\ninput size, as shown
