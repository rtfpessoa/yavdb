  title: Credential Exposure
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:quality-gates][1] is a Jenkins plugin that will
    fail the build whenever the Quality Gates criteria in the Sonar analysis
    aren\'t met.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Credential Exposure.
    It transmits configured credentials in plain text as part of its global
    Jenkins configuration form, potentially resulting in their exposure.
