  title: Insecure Permissions
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure
    Permissions. Active Directory Plugin 2.19 and earlier does not perform a
    permission check in an HTTP endpoint. This allows attackers with
    Overall/Read permission to access the domain health check diagnostic
    page.Active Directory Plugin 2.20 requires Overall/Administer permission
    to access the domain health check diagnostic page.

  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). Active Directory Plugin 2.19 and earlier does not
    require POST requests for multiple HTTP endpoints implementing
    connection and authentication tests, resulting in cross-site request
    forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities. This vulnerability allows attackers to
    perform connection tests, connecting to attacker-specified or previously
    configured Active Directory servers using attacker-specified
    credentials.

  title: Improper Authentication
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authentication. Active Directory Plugin implements two separate modes:
    Integration with ADSI on Windows, and an OS agnostic LDAP-based mode.
    Optionally, to reduce lookup time, a cache can be configured to remember
    user lookups and user authentications.In Active Directory Plugin 2.19
    and earlier, when run in Windows/ADSI mode, the provided password was
    not used when looking up an applicable cache entry. This allows
    attackers to log in as any user using any password while a successful
    authentication of that user is still in the cache.

  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. Active Directory Plugin implements two separate modes:
    Integration with ADSI on Windows, and an OS agnostic LDAP-based mode.The
    Windows/ADSI mode does not specifically prohibit use of empty passwords
    in Active Directory Plugin 2.19 and earlier. If the Active Directory
    server allows the unauthenticated bind operation, this allows attackers
    to log in to Jenkins as any user by providing an empty password.

  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. Active Directory Plugin implements two separate modes:
    Integration with ADSI on Windows, and an OS agnostic LDAP-based mode.
    The LDAP-based mode in Active Directory Plugin 2.19 and earlier shares
    code between user lookup and user authentication and distinguishes these
    behaviors through the use of a magic constant used in place of a real
    password. This allows attackers to log in as any user if the magic
    constant is used as the password in Active Directory Plugin 2.19 and
    earlier.

  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:active-directory][1] With this plugin, you can
    configure Jenkins to authenticate the username and the password through
    Active Directory.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    due to missing certificate check.
