  title: Denial of Service
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:node-fetch][1] is an A light-weight module that brings
    window.fetch to node.js

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service.
    Node Fetch did not honor the `size` option after following a redirect,
    which means that when a content size was over the limit, a FetchError
    would never get thrown and the process would end without failure.
