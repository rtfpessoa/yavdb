  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: "[org.webjars.npm:merge][1] is a WebJar for merge\n\nAffected versions
    of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.\nThe \\'merge\\' function
    already checks for \\'**proto**\\' keys in an\nobject to prevent prototype pollution,
    but does not check for\n\\'constructor\\' or \\'prototype\\' keys.\n\n\n\n[1]:
    https://github.com/yeikos/js.merge\n\\nPrototype Pollution is a vulnerability
    affecting JavaScript. Prototype\nPollution refers to the ability to inject properties
    into existing\nJavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript\nallows
    all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical\nattributes such
    as `_proto_`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker\nmanipulates these attributes
    to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript\napplication object prototype of the base
    object by injecting other\nvalues. Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then
    inherited by all\nthe JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that
    happens,\nthis leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript\nexceptions,
    or it tampers with the application source code to force the\ncode path that the
    attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code\nexecution.\n\nThere are two
    main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n* Unsafe `Object` recursive
    merge\n\n* Property definition by path\n\n### Unsafe Object recursive merge   {#unsafe-object-recursive-merge}\n\nThe
    logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following\nhigh-level
    model:\n\n    merge (target, source)\n    \n      foreach property of source\n
    \   \n        if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n
    \   \n          merge(target[property], source[property])\n    \n        else\n
    \   \n          target[property] = source[property]\n\n\n\nWhen the source object
    contains a property named `_proto_` defined with\n`Object.defineProperty()` ,
    the condition that checks if the property\nexists and is an object on both the
    target and the source passes and the\nmerge recurses with the target, being the
    prototype of `Object` and the\nsource of `Object` as defined by the attacker.
    Properties are then\ncopied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are
    a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges,\nwhich occur when a recursive
    merge is conducted on an empty object:\n`merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek`
    are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive\nmerge attacks.\n\n### Property
    definition by path   {#property-definition-by-path}\n\nThere are a few JavaScript
    libraries that use an API to define property\nvalues on an object based on a given
    path. The function that is\ngenerally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object,
    path,\nvalue)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set
    this value\nto `_proto_.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype
    of the\nclass of the object.\n\n"

  title: Prototype  Pollution
  description: |
    [merge][1] is used to merge multiple objects into one object.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution
    via the `merge.recursive` function. It can be tricked into adding or
    modifying properties of the Object prototype. These properties will be
    present on all objects.
