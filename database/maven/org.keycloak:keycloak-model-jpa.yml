  title: Improper Authorization
  description: |+
    [org.keycloak:keycloak-model-jpa](None) is an Identity and Access
    Management module for Keycloak JPA.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authorization. A community-only flaw was found in Keycloak, where a
    malicious user registers as oneself. The attacker could then use the
    remove devices form to post different credential IDs and possibly remove
    MFA devices for other users.
