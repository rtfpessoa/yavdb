  title: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:StashBranchParameter][1] is a Jenkins CI Plugin
    that searches for branches and tags to use as a parameter.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cleartext
    Transmission of Sensitive Information. Stash Branch Parameter Plugin
    stores Stash API passwords in its global configuration file. While the
    password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as
    part of the configuration. This can result in the exposure of the
    password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting
    vulnerabilities, and similar situations. This only affects Jenkins
    before 2.236, including 2.235.x LTS, as Jenkins 2.236 introduces a
    security hardening that transparently encrypts and decrypts data used
    for a Jenkins password form field.
