  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [`org.apache.karaf:org.apache.karaf.main`][1] is a modern and
    polymorphic container.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Authentication Bypass
    via the `getByName()` method. An attacker may spoof DNS entries by using
    this method.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [org.apache.karaf:org.apache.karaf.main][1] is an is a modern and
    polymorphic container.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of
    Sevice (DoS) attacks. Apache Karaf enables a shutdown port on the
    loopback interface, which allows local users to cause a denial of
    service (shutdown) by sending a shutdown command to all listening high
    ports.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: LDAP injection
  description: |
    [`org.apache.karaf:org.apache.karaf.main`][1] is a modern and
    polymorphic container.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to LDAP Injection.
    Apache Karaf uses the LDAPLoginModule to authenticate users to a
    directory via LDAP. However, it is not encoding usernames properly and
    hence is vulnerable to LDAP injection attacks.

    While it appears that it not possible to exploit this vulnerability to
    allow an attacker to gain remote access, it allows an attacker to insert
    special characters into the search query step. Therefore, it can
    potentially be exploited as part of a Denial Of Service attack.
