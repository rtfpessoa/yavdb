  title: "[CVE-2016-5007]  Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls"
  description: Both Spring Security 3.2.x, 4.0.x, 4.1.0 and the Spring Framework 3.2.x,
    4.0.x, 4.1.x, 4.2.x rely on URL pattern mappings for authorization and for mapping
    requests to controllers respectively. Differences in the strictness of the pattern
    matching mechanisms, for example with regards to space trimming in path segments,
    can lead Spring Security to not recognize certain paths as not protected that
    are in fact mapped to Spring MVC controllers that should be protected. The problem
    is compounded by the fact that the Spring Framework provides richer features with
    regards to pattern matching as well as by the fact that pattern matching in each
    Spring Security and the Spring Framework can easily be customized creating additional
    differences.

  title: "[CVE-2016-9879] An issue was discovered in Pivotal Spring Security before
    3.2.10, 4.1.x before 4..."
  description: An issue was discovered in Pivotal Spring Security before 3.2.10, 4.1.x
    before 4.1.4, and 4.2.x before 4.2.1. Spring Security does not consider URL path
    parameters when processing security constraints. By adding a URL path parameter
    with an encoded "/" to a request, an attacker may be able to bypass a security
    constraint. The root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling
    of path parameters in the Servlet Specification. Some Servlet containers include
    path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do not. Spring
    Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the process of mapping
    requests to security constraints. The unexpected presence of path parameters can
    cause a constraint to be bypassed. Users of Apache Tomcat (all current versions)
    are not affected by this vulnerability since Tomcat follows the guidance previously
    provided by the Servlet Expert group and strips path parameters from the value
    returned by getContextPath(), getServletPath(), and getPathInfo(). Users of other
    Servlet containers based on Apache Tomcat may or may not be affected depending
    on whether or not the handling of path parameters has been modified. Users of
    IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5.x are known to be affected. Users of other
    containers that implement the Servlet specification may be affected.
