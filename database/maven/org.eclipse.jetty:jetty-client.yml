  description: Jetty 8.1.0.RC2 and earlier computes hash values for form parameters
    without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending
    many crafted parameters.

  title: Authorization Bypass
  description: |
    [org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-client][1] is a is an asynchronous http client
    module fro jetty server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authorization
    Bypass. A large chunk size could be interpreted as a smaller chunk size
    and content sent as chunk body could be interpreted as a pipelined
    request. If Jetty was deployed behind an intermediary that imposed some
    authorization and that intermediary allowed arbitrarily large chunks to
    be passed on unchanged, then this flaw could be used to bypass the
    authorization imposed by the intermediary as the fake pipelined request
    would not be interpreted by the intermediary as a request.
