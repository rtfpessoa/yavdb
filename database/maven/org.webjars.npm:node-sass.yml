  title: Use After Free
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:node-sass][1] is a Node.js bindings to libsass.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Use After Free. A
    use-after-free vulnerability exists in `handle_error()` in
    `sass_context.cpp` in LibSass 3.4.x and 3.5.x through 3.5.4 that could
    be leveraged to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
    possibly unspecified other impact. `node-sass` is affected by this
    vulnerability due to its usage of `libsass`.

  title: NULL Pointer Dereference
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:node-sass][1] is a Node.js bindings to libsass.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to NULL Pointer
    Dereference via the function `Sass::Expand::operator` which could be
    leveraged by an attacker to cause a denial of service (application
    crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact. Note: `node-sass` is
    affected by this vulnerability due to its bundled usage of the `libsass`
    package.

    [org.webjars.npm:node-sass][1] is a Node.js bindings to libsass.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Out-of-bounds Read.
    There is an illegal address access in `Sass::Eval::operator()` in
    `eval.cpp`, leading to a remote denial of service attack. NOTE: this is
    similar to CVE-2017-11555 but remains exploitable after the vendor\'s
    CVE-2017-11555 fix (available from GitHub after 2017-07-24). Note:
    `node-sass` is affected by this vulnerability due to its bundled usage
    of the `libsass` package.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
