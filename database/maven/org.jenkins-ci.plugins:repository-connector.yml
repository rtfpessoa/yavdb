  title: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:repository-connector][1] is a repository
    Connector Jenkins plugin that adds a build step which allows to resolve
    artifacts from a maven repository like nexus.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. An insufficiently protected credentials
    vulnerability exists in

    * `src/main/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/repositoryconnector/ArtifactDeployer.java`
    * `src/main/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/repositoryconnector/Repository.java`
    * `src/main/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/repositoryconnector/UserPwd.java`

    This can be abused by an attacker with local file system access or
    control of a Jenkins administrator\'s web browser (e.g. malicious
    extension) to retrieve the password stored in the plugin configuration.

  title: Credential Exposure
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:repository-connector][1] is a repository
    Connector Jenkins plugin that adds a build step which allows to resolve
    artifacts from a maven repository like nexus.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Credential Exposure.
    It transmits configured credentials in plain text as part of its global
    Jenkins configuration form, potentially resulting in their exposure.
