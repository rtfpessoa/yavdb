  title: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch
  description: |
    [org.java-websocket:Java-WebSocket][1] is a barebones WebSocket server
    and client implementation written in 100% Java.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Validation
    of Certificate with Host Mismatch. The Java-WebSocket Client does not
    perform hostname verification. This means that SSL certificates of other
    hosts are accepted as long as they are trusted. To exploit this
    vulnerability an attacker has to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM)
    attack between a Java application using the Java-WebSocket Client and an
    WebSocket server it\'s connecting to. TLS normally protects users and
    systems against MITM attacks, it cannot if certificates from other
    trusted hosts are accepted by the client.
