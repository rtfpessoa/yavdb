  title: Uncontrolled Memory Allocation
  description: |
    [io.netty:netty-codec][1] is an event-driven asynchronous network
    application framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Uncontrolled Memory
    Allocation while decoding a ZlibEncoded byte stream. An attacker could
    send a large ZlibEncoded byte stream to the Netty server, forcing the
    server to allocate all of its free memory to a single decoder.
