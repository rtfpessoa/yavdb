  title: Time of Check Time of Use (TOCTOU)
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:chownr][1] is a package that takes the same arguments
    as `fs.chown()`

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Time of Check Time
    of Use (TOCTOU). Affected versions of this package are vulnerable toTime
    of Check Time of Use (TOCTOU) attacks.

    It does not dereference symbolic links and changes the owner of the
    link, which can trick it into descending into unintended trees if a
    non-symlink is replaced by a symlink at a critical moment:

              fs.lstat(pathChild, function(er, stats) {
                if (er)
                  return cb(er)
                if (!stats.isSymbolicLink())
                  chownr(pathChild, uid, gid, then)
