  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.bouncycastle:bcprov-ext-jdk15to18][1] is a Java implementation of
    cryptographic algorithms.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. Attackers can obtain sensitive information about a private
    exponent because of Observable Differences in Behavior to Error Inputs.
    This occurs in `org.bouncycastle.crypto.encodings.OAEPEncoding`. Sending
    invalid `ciphertext` that decrypts to a short payload in the OAEP
    Decoder could result in the throwing of an early exception, potentially
    leaking some information about the private exponent of the RSA private
    key performing the encryption.
