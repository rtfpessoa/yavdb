  title: Unprotected Storage of Credentials
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:whitesource][1] is a White Source external
    update agent for Jenkins CI.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Unprotected Storage
    of Credentials. It stores credentials in plain text as part of its
    global configuration file
    `org.whitesource.jenkins.pipeline.WhiteSourcePipelineStep.xml` and job
    `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be
    viewed by users with Extended Read permission (in the case of job
    `config.xml` files) or access to the master file system.
