  title: Arbitrary OGNL Statemant Execution
  description: |
    [`org.apache.jackrabbit:oak-core`][1] ParametersInterceptor in
    OpenSymphony XWork 2.0.x before 2.0.6 and 2.1.x before 2.1.2, as used in
    Apache Struts and other products, does not properly restrict # (pound
    sign) references to context objects, which allows remote attackers to
    execute Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) statements and modify
    server-side context objects, as demonstrated by use of a \\u0023
    representation for the # character.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.apache.jackrabbit:oak-core][1] is a complementary implementation of
    the JCR specification.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The optional initial password change and password expiration
    features are prone to a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability.
    The code mandates the changed password to be passed as an additional
    attribute to the credentials object but does not remove it upon
    processing during the first phase of the authentication. In combination
    with additional, independent authentication mechanisms, this may lead to
    the new password being disclosed.
