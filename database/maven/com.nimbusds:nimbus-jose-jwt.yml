  title: Elliptic Curve Key Disclosure
  description: |
    [`com.nimbusds:nimbus-jose-jwt`][1] is a Java library for Javascript
    Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Elliptic Curve Key
    Disclosure.

    A JSON Web Token (JWT) defines a container that transports data between
    two parties. When a JWT is signed with a private key by one of the
    parties, it\'s known as a JSON Web Signature (JWS).

    The \"JWK\" (JSON Web Key) is a JSON based open standard used for
    creating access tokens. JWK\'s `Header Parameter` allows it to include
    the public key that corresponds to the key used to sign the JWS. If the
    Header Parameter includes this public key, an attacker could then use it
    to generate a private key / public key pair, send the public key
    together with the signature and the signature will be valid.

    This vulnerability is related to [SNYK-JAVA-ORGBITBUCKETBC-30206][2] and
    [npm:node-jose:20170313][3]

  title: Invalid Elliptic Curve Attack
  description: |
    [`com.nimbusds:nimbus-jose-jwt`][1] is a Java library for Javascript
    Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to an Invalid Elliptic
    Curve Attack.

    Nimbus JOSE+JWT before 4.36 proceeds with ECKey construction without
    ensuring that the public `x` and `y` coordinates are on the specified
    curve, which allows attackers to conduct an Invalid Curve Attack in
    environments where the JCE provider lacks the applicable curve
    validation.
