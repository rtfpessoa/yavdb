  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [jetty:jetty][1] is an old release of jetty. This artifact has been
    moved to org.mortbay.jetty:jetty.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. The system\'s temporary directory is shared between all
    users on that system. A collocated user can observe the process of
    creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and
    race to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory. If the
    attacker wins the race then they will have read and write permission to
    the subdirectory used to unpack web applications, including their
    WEB-INF/lib jar files and JSP files. If any code is ever executed out of
    this temporary directory, this can lead to a local privilege escalation
    vulnerability.
