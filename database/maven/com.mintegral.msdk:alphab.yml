  title: "Malicious \U000E016E\U000E0170\U000E016DPackage"
  description: |
    [com.mintegral.msdk:alphab][1] is a malicious package. The Android SDK
    distributed by the company contains malicious functionality in this
    module that tracks:

    1.  Downloads from Google urls either within Google apps or via browser
        including file downloads, e-mail attachments and Google Docs links.
    2.  All apk downloads, either organic or not. Mintegral listens to
        download events in Android\'s download manager and detects if the
        downloaded file\'s url contains:

    a. `google.com` or comes from a Google app (the `com.android.vending`
    package)

    b. Ends with `.apk` for apk downloads

    In both cases, the module sends the captured data back to Mintegral\'s
    servers.

    Note that the malicious functionality keeps running even if the app is
    currently not in focus (running in the background).
