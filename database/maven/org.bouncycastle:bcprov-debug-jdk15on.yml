  title: Comparison Using Wrong Factors
  description: |
    [org.bouncycastle:bcprov-debug-jdk15on][1] is a Java implementation of
    cryptographic algorithms.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Comparison Using
    Wrong Factors. The `OpenBSDBCrypt.checkPassword` utility method compared
    incorrect data when checking the password, allowing incorrect passwords
    to indicate they were matching with previously hashed ones that were
    different.
