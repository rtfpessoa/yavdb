  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [org.openhab.addons.bundles:org.openhab.transform.exec][1] is an OpenHAB
    Add On.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). It allows a remote attacker to use REST calls to
    install the `EXEC` binding or `EXEC` transformation service and execute
    arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the user running
    openHAB. Starting with version 2.5.2 all commands need to be whitelisted
    in a local file which cannot be changed via REST calls.
