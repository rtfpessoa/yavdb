  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:scm-filter-jervis][1] is a plugin that is
    intended for Jenkins infrastructure relying on jervis to deliver
    software in a self-service manner.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). It does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the
    instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a remote code
    execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure
    jobs with the filter, or control the contents of a previously configured
    jobâ€™s SCM repository.
