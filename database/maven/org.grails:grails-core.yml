  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [org.grails:grails-core][1] is a framework used to build web
    applications with the Groovy programming language. The core framework is
    very extensible and there are numerous plugins available that provide
    easy integration of add-on features.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM). Cleartext HTTP protocol is used within specific versions of
    Grails core to resolve the SDKMan notification service. It should be
    noted that dependencies were not resolved or fetched over cleartext
    HTTP. As such, success exploitation of this vulnerability is low.
