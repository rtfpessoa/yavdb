  title: Insecure Randomness
  description: |
    [cryptiles][1] is a package for general crypto utilities.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness.
    The `randomDigits()` method is supposed to return a cryptographically
    strong pseudo-random data string, but it was biased to certain digits.
    An attacker could be able to guess the created digits.
