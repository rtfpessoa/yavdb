  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [`org.apache.karaf:org.apache.karaf.client`][1] is a modern and
    polymorphic container.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure
    due to storing the password with the `interactive()` method. This method
    stores sensitive data in a String object, making it impossible to
    reliably purge the data from memory.
