  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [org.richfaces:richfaces][1] is an open source Ajax-enabled component
    library for JavaServer Faces, hosted by JBoss.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. `ResourceBuilderImpl.java` in the RichFaces does not restrict
    the classes for which deserialization methods can be called, which
    allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted serialized
    data.
