  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [org.apache.unomi:unomi-common][1] is a package that stores user profile
    information and is mostly used to provide a backend server for A/B
    testing and personalization.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). It allows conditions to use OGNL scripting which offers
    the possibility to call static Java classes from the JDK that could
    execute code with the permission level of the running Java process.
