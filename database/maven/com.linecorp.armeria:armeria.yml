    [com.linecorp.armeria:armeria][1] is an asynchronous HTTP/2 RPC/REST
    client/server library built on top of Java 8, Netty, Thrift and gRPC
    (armeria)

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Response
    Splitting. It allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers
    via CRLF sequences when unsanitized data is used to populate the headers
    of an HTTP response. This vulnerability has been patched in 0.97.0.
