  title: Information Disclosure
  description: |
    [org.elasticsearch.plugin:x-pack][1] is an Elasticsearch Expanded Pack
    Plugin

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Disclosure. A field disclosure flaw was found when running a scrolling
    search with Field Level Security. If a user runs the same query another
    more privileged user recently ran, the scrolling search can leak fields
    that should be hidden. This could result in an attacker gaining
    additional permissions against a restricted index.
