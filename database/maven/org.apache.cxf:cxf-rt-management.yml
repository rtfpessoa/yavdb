  title: Man in The Middle (MiTM)
  description: |
    [org.apache.cxf:cxf-rt-management][1] is an Apache CXF Runtime
    Management package.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man in The Middle
    (MiTM). Apache CXF has the ability to integrate with JMX by registering
    an `InstrumentationManager` extension with the CXF bus. If the
    `createMBServerConnectorFactory` property of the default
    `InstrumentationManagerImpl` is not disabled, then it is vulnerable to a
    man-in-the-middle (MITM) style attack.

    An attacker on the same host can connect to the registry and rebind the
    entry to another server, thus acting as a proxy to the original. They
    are then able to gain access to all of the information that is sent and
    received over JMX.
