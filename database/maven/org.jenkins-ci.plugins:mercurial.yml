  title: Insecure Permissions
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure
    Permissions. Mercurial Plugin 2.11 and earlier does not perform a
    permission check in an HTTP endpoint. This allows attackers with
    Overall/Read permission to obtain a list of names of configured
    Mercurial installations.Mercurial Plugin 2.12 performs permission checks
    when listing configured Mercurial installations.

  title: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to XML External Entity
    (XXE) Injection. Mercurial Plugin 2.11 and earlier does not configure
    its XML changelog parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
    This allows attackers able to control an agent process to have Jenkins
    parse a crafted changelog file that uses external entities for
    extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request
    forgery.

    \nXXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML
    input. XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding
    documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
    By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external
    entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing.
    When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and
    include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.

    Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive
    data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or
    relative paths in the system identifier.

    For example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element-
    username.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
           <username>John</username>
        </xml>
    {: .language-xml}

    An external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and
    present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or
    remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML
    entity that would fetch the content of `/etc/passwd` and display it to
    the user rendered by `username`.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
        <!DOCTYPE foo [
           <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
           <username>&xxe;</username>
        </xml>
    {: .language-xml}

    Other XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop
    returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading
    to Denial of Service.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:mercurial][1] integrates the Mercurial version
    control system with Jenkins.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    ExposureÂ in `MercurialStatus.java`. It allows an attacker with network
    access to obtain a list of nodes and users.
