  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [org.apache.cxf:cxf-rt-rs-security-sso-oidc][1] is an Apache CXF Runtime
    OpenId Connect library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. There is a vulnerability in the access token services, where it
    does not validate that the authenticated principal is equal to that of
    the supplied clientId parameter in the request. If a malicious client
    was able to somehow steal an authorization code issued to another
    client, then they could exploit this vulnerability to obtain an access
    token for the other client.
