  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |+
    [org.webjars:jquery][1] JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML
    document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax
    much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of
    browsers.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS). The `location.hash()` function was used to select elements, but
    also allows remote attackers to inject script into the page.

    This vulnerability is related to a vulnerability in [jQuery-migrate][2]
    and in [fullpage.js](npm:fullpage.js:20151207).



    [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery
    [2]: https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:jquery-migrate:20130419
    \nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a
    legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as
    originating from a trusted source.

    This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web
    application then delivers that data to its users along with other
    trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly
    executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side
    languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that
    are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.

    ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is
    exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this
    manipulation is the top method for securing code against this
    vulnerability.

    Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and
    particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those
    characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example,
    in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in
    order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while
    within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious
    content is injected into an application that escapes special characters
    and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those
    characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser
    if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this
    way the attempted attack is diverted.

    The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP
    HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to
    expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and
    functionality and deliver malware.

    ### Types of attacks   {#types-of-attacks}

    There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:

    | Type | Origin | Description |
    |----------
    | **Stored** | Server | The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link. |
    | **Reflected** | Server | The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. |
    | **DOM-based** | Client | The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data. |
    | **Mutated** |  | The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters. |

    ### Affected environments   {#affected-environments}

    The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:

    * Web servers
    * Application servers
    * Web application environments

    ### How to prevent   {#how-to-prevent}

    This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically
    protect your code:

    * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back,
      ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing
      anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters
      during searches.
    * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces
      to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.
    * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.
    * Redirect invalid requests.
    * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP
      addresses, and invalidate those sessions.
    * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to
      disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.
    * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your
      code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.

  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: "[org.webjars:jquery][1] is a JavaScript library. It makes things like\nHTML
    document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and\nAjax much
    simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude\nof browsers.\n\nAffected
    versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.\nThe `extend`
    function can be tricked into modifying the prototype of\n`Object` when the attacker
    controls part of the structure passed to this\nfunction. This can let an attacker
    add or modify an existing property\nthat will then exist on all objects.\n\n\n\n[1]:
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery\n\\nPrototype Pollution is a vulnerability
    affecting JavaScript. Prototype\nPollution refers to the ability to inject properties
    into existing\nJavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript\nallows
    all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical\nattributes such
    as `_proto_`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker\nmanipulates these attributes
    to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript\napplication object prototype of the base
    object by injecting other\nvalues. Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then
    inherited by all\nthe JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that
    happens,\nthis leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript\nexceptions,
    or it tampers with the application source code to force the\ncode path that the
    attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code\nexecution.\n\nThere are two
    main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n* Unsafe `Object` recursive
    merge\n\n* Property definition by path\n\n### Unsafe Object recursive merge   {#unsafe-object-recursive-merge}\n\nThe
    logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following\nhigh-level
    model:\n\n    merge (target, source)\n    \n      foreach property of source\n
    \   \n        if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n
    \   \n          merge(target[property], source[property])\n    \n        else\n
    \   \n          target[property] = source[property]\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\nWhen the
    source object contains a property named `_proto_` defined with\n`Object.defineProperty()`
    , the condition that checks if the property\nexists and is an object on both the
    target and the source passes and the\nmerge recurses with the target, being the
    prototype of `Object` and the\nsource of `Object` as defined by the attacker.
    Properties are then\ncopied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are
    a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges,\nwhich occur when a recursive
    merge is conducted on an empty object:\n`merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek`
    are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive\nmerge attacks.\n\n### Property
    definition by path   {#property-definition-by-path}\n\nThere are a few JavaScript
    libraries that use an API to define property\nvalues on an object based on a given
    path. The function that is\ngenerally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object,
    path,\nvalue)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set
    this value\nto `_proto_.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype
    of the\nclass of the object.\n\n"

    of browsers.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS). The `jQuery(strInput)` function does not differentiate selectors
    from HTML in a reliable fashion. In the vulnerable version, jQuery
    determined whether the input was HTML or not by looking for the \'&lt;\'
    character anywhere in the string, giving attackers more flexibility when
    attempting to construct malicious payload.

    In the fixed versions, jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it
    explicitly starts with \'&lt;\', limiting exploitability only to
    attackers who can control the beginning of a string, which is far less
    common.

    of browsers.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS) due to removing a logic that lowercased attribute names. Any
    attribute getter using a mixed-cased name for boolean attributes goes
    into an infinite recursion, exceeding the stack call limit.



    [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
