  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:yarn][1] is a package for dependency management.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM). Npm credentials such as `_authToken` were found to be sent over
    clear text when processing scoped packages that are listed as resolved.
    This could allow a suitably positioned attacker to eavesdrop and
    compromise the sent credentials.

  title: Arbitrary File Write
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:yarn][1] is a package for dependency management.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Write. The package install functionality can be abused to generate
    arbitrary symlinks on the host filesystem by using specially crafted
    `bin` keys. Existing files could be overwritten depending on the current
    user permission set.
