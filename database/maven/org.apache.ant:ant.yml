  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`org.apache.ant:ant`][1] Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in the
    sorting algorithms in bzip2 compressing stream
    (BZip2CompressorOutputStream) in Apache Commons Compress before 1.4.1
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption)
    via a file with many repeating inputs.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Insecure Default
  description: |
    [org.apache.ant:ant][1] is a software tool for automating software build
    processes which originated from the Apache Tomcat project in early 2000.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Default. It
    uses the default temporary directory identified by the Java system
    property `java.io.tmpdir` for several tasks and may thus leak sensitive
    information. The `fixcrlf` and `replaceregexp` tasks also copy files
    from the temporary directory back into the build tree allowing an
    attacker to inject modified source files into the build process.
