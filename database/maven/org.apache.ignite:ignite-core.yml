    [org.apache.ignite:ignite-core][1] is a memory-centric distributed
    database, caching, and processing platform for transactional,
    analytical, and streaming workloads delivering in-memory speeds at
    petabyte scale.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. It uses an update notifier component to update the users about
    new project releases that include additional functionality, bug fixes
    and performance improvements. To do that the component communicates to
    an external PHP server ([http://ignite.run][2]) where it needs to send
    some system properties like Apache Ignite or Java version. Some of the
    properties might contain user sensitive information.

  title: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
  description: |+
    [org.apache.ignite:ignite-core][1] is a memory-centric distributed
    database, caching, and processing platform for transactional,
    analytical, and streaming workloads delivering in-memory speeds at
    petabyte scale.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to XML External Entity
    (XXE) Injection. An attacker could read arbitrary files via XXE in
    modified `update-notifier` documents.



    [1]: https://github.com/apache/ignite
    \nXXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML
    input. XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding
    documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
    By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external
    entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing.
    When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and
    include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.

    Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive
    data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or
    relative paths in the system identifier.

    For example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element-
    username.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
           <username>John</username>
        </xml>
    {: .language-xml}

    An external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and
    present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or
    remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML
    entity that would fetch the content of `/etc/passwd` and display it to
    the user rendered by `username`.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
        <!DOCTYPE foo [
           <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
           <username>&xxe;</username>
        </xml>
    {: .language-xml}

    Other XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop
    returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading
    to Denial of Service.

  title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  description: |
    [org.apache.ignite:ignite-core][1] is a memory-centric multi-model
    distributed database, caching, and processing platform for
    transactional, analytical, and streaming workloads, delivering in-memory
    speeds at petabyte scale.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of
    Untrusted Data. The serialization mechanism does not have a list of
    classes allowed for serialization/deserialization, which makes it
    possible to run arbitrary code when 3-rd party vulnerable classes are
    present in Ignite classpath. The vulnerability can be exploited if the
    one sends a specially prepared form of a serialized object to one of the
    deserialization endpoints of some Ignite components - discovery SPI,
    Ignite persistence, Memcached endpoint, socket steamer.



    [1]: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.ignite/ignite-core
    \nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of
    bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent
    through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of
    bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for
    communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence
    (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part
    of popular protocols like *Remote Method Invocation (RMI)*, *Java
    Management Extension (JMX)*, *Java Messaging System (JMS)*, *Action
    Message Format (AMF)*, *Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState*, etc.

    *Deserialization of untrusted data* ([CWE-502][1]), is when the
    application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying
    that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control
    the state or the flow of the execution.

    Java deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest
    in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be
    abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library
    (Apache Commons Collection)][2]. These classes were used in zero-days
    affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.

    An attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a
    vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted
    data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the
    deserializer, getting the command executed.
