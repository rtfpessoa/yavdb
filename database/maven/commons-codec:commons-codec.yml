  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [commons-codec:commons-codec][1] is a package that contains simple
    encoder and decoders for various formats such as Base64 and Hexadecimal.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. When there is no byte array value that can be encoded into a
    string the Base32 implementation does not reject it, and instead decodes
    it into an arbitrary value which can be re-encoded again using the same
    implementation. This allows for information exposure exploits such as
    tunneling additional information via seemingly valid base 32 strings.
