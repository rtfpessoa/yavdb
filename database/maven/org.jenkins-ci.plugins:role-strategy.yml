  title: Improper Authorization
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authorization. Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin 2.12 and newer
    uses a cache to speed up permission lookups.In Role-based Authorization
    Strategy Plugin 3.0 and earlier this cache is not invalidated properly
    when an administrator changes the permission configuration. This can
    result in permissions being granted long after the configuration was
    changed to no longer grant them.Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin
    3.1 properly invalidates the cache on configuration changes.

  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:role-strategy][1] is meant to be used from
    Hudson or Jenkins to add a new role-based mechanism to manager users\'
    permissions.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). It was not requiring requests to its `API` be sent via
    `POST`, This allowed attackers to add administrator role to any user, or
    to remove the authorization configuration, preventing legitimate access
    to Jenkins.
