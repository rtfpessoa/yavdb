  title: Insecure Defaults
  description: |
    [org.apache.beam:beam-sdks-java-io-mongodb][1] is an unified programming
    model for Batch and Streaming.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Defaults.
    It has an option to disable SSL trust verification. However this
    configuration is not respected and the certificate verification disables
    trust verification in every case. This exclusion also gets registered
    globally which disables trust checking for any code running in the same
    JVM.
