  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:harvest][1] is a plugin makes it possible to
    retrieve files from a Harvest SCM.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The plugin stores SCM passwords unencrypted in its global
    configuration file `hudson.plugins.harvest.HarvestSCM.xml` and in job
    `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master. These credentials can be
    viewed by users with Extended Read permission (job config.xml only) or
    access to the master file system (both).

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
