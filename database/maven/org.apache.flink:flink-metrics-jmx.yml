  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.apache.flink:flink-metrics-jmx][1] is an open-source
    stream-processing framework developed by the Apache Software Foundation.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. When running a process with an enabled `JMXReporter`, with a
    port configured via `metrics.reporter.<reporter_name>.port`, an attacker
    with local access to the machine and JMX port can execute a
    man-in-the-middle attack using a specially crafted request to rebind the
    JMXRMI registry to one under the attacker\'s control. This compromises
    any connection established to the process via JMX, allowing extraction
    of credentials and any other transferred data.
