  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:copyartifact][1] is a plugin that lets you
    specify which build to copy artifacts from (e.g. the last
    successful/stable build, by build number, or by a build parameter).

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. It performs improper permission checks when determining whether
    a build can copy artifacts from another project build. This allows
    attackers, usually with Job/Configure permission, to configure jobs to
    copy artifacts from jobs they have no permission to access.
