  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [junit:junit][1] is an unit testing framework for Java

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The JUnit4 test rule `TemporaryFolder` contains a local
    information disclosure vulnerability. On Unix like systems, the
    system\'s temporary directory is shared between all users on that
    system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into
    this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that
    same system.

    *Note:* This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the
    contents of these directories or files. This only affects Unix like
    systems.
