  description: '** DISPUTED ** The AES-GCM specification in RFC 5084, as used in Android
    5.x and 6.x, recommends 12 octets for the aes-ICVlen parameter field, which might
    make it easier for attackers to defeat a cryptographic protection mechanism and
    discover an authentication key via a crafted application, aka internal bug 26234568.  NOTE:
    The vendor disputes the existence of this potential issue in Android, stating
    "This CVE was raised in error: it referred to the authentication tag size in GCM,
    whose default according to ASN.1 encoding (12 bytes) can lead to vulnerabilities.
    After careful consideration, it was decided that the insecure default value of
    12 bytes was a default only for the encoding and not default anywhere else in
    Android, and hence no vulnerability existed."'

    [`org.bouncycastle:bcprov-ext-jdk15on`][1] Affected versions of this

    \nElliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is used in key exchange
    protocolsdigital signatures, or for pseudo-random number generators. An
    elliptic curve in cryptography is a set of points over a finite field
    satisfying the following equation: `y^2 = x^3 + ax + b`. On the elliptic
    curve, a single operation can be executed: point addition.

    Elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) is an anonymous key exchange
    protocol that allows two parties (say, between a client and server) to
    establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.

    An Invalid Curve Attack occurs when a client forces the server to
    compute a common secret using a point outside of the defined curve. The
    server may disclose information, allowing a skilled attacker to
    calculate the secret key.
