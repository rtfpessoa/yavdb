  title: Reverse Tabnabbing
  description: |
    [org.webjars.bower:quill][1] is a modern rich text editor built for
    compatibility and extensibility.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Reverse Tabnabbing
    due to use of `target='_blank'` in anchor tags, allowing attackers to
    access `window.opener` for the original page when opening links. This is
    commonly used for phishing attacks.

  description: |
    [org.webjars.bower:quill][1] is a modern rich text editor built for
    compatibility and extensibility.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Reverse Tabnabbing
    via the snow theme. The link has the target attribute set to `_blank`
    but has no `rel` property. This means that documents containing
    untrusted links make the page they are embedded in susceptible to
    tabnabbing.
