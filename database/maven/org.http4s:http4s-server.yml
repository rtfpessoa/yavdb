  title: Local File Inclusion
  description: |
    [org.http4s:http4s-server][1] is a base library for building http4s
    servers.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Local File
    Inclusion. This vulnerability applies to all users of
    `org.http4s.server.staticcontent.FileService`,
    `org.http4s.server.staticcontent.ResourceService` and
    `org.http4s.server.staticcontent.WebjarService`. URI normalization is
    applied incorrectly. Requests whose path info contain `../` or `//` can
    expose resources outside of the configured location.
