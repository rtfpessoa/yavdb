  title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  description: |
    [com.google.guava:guava][1] is a set of core libraries that includes new
    collection types (such as multimap and multiset,immutable collections, a
    graph library, functional types, an in-memory cache and more.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of
    Untrusted Data. During deserialization, two Guava classes accept a
    caller-specified size parameter and eagerly allocate an array of that
    size:

    * `AtomicDoubleArray` (when serialized with Java serialization)
    * `CompoundOrdering` (when serialized with GWT serialization)

    An attacker may be able to send a specially crafted request which with
    then cause the server to allocate all it\'s memory, without validation
    whether the data size is reasonable.

    \nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of
    bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent
    through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of
    bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for
    communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence
    (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part
    of popular protocols like *Remote Method Invocation (RMI)*, *Java
    Management Extension (JMX)*, *Java Messaging System (JMS)*, *Action
    Message Format (AMF)*, *Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState*, etc.

    *Deserialization of untrusted data* ([CWE-502][1]), is when the
    application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying
    that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control
    the state or the flow of the execution.

    Java deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest
    in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be
    abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library
    (Apache Commons Collection)][2]. These classes were used in zero-days
    affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.

    An attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a
    vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted
    data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the
    deserializer, getting the command executed.
