  title: Arbitrary File Overwrite
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:tar][1] is a full-featured Tar for Node.js.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Overwrite. Extracting tarballs containing a hard-link to a file that
    already exists in the system, and a file that matches the hard-link may
    overwrite system\'s files with the contents of the extracted file.

  title: Symlink File Overwrite
  description: |
    The [`tar`][1] module prior to version 2.0.0 does not properly normalize
    symbolic links pointing to targets outside the extraction root. As a
    result, packages may hold symbolic links to parent and sibling
    directories and overwrite those files when the package is extracted.
