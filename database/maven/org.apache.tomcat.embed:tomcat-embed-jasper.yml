    [`org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-jasper`][1] Apache Tomcat before
    6.0.40, 7.x before 7.0.54, and 8.x before 8.0.6 does not properly
    constrain the class loader that accesses the XML parser used with an
    XSLT stylesheet, which allows remote attackers to (1) read arbitrary
    files via a crafted web application that provides an XML external entity
    declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML
    External Entity (XXE) issue, or (2) read files associated with different
    web applications on a single Tomcat instance via a crafted web
    application.
