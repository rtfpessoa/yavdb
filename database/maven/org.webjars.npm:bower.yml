  title: Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip)
  description: "[org.webjars.npm:bower][1] offers a generic, unopinionated solution
    to\nthe problem of front-end package management.\n\nAffected versions of this
    package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write\nvia Archive Extraction (Zip Slip).
    Attackers can write arbitrary files\nwhen a malicious archive is extracted.\n\n\n\n[1]:
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower\n\\nIt is exploited using a specially crafted
    zip archive, that holds path\ntraversal filenames. When exploited, a filename
    in a malicious archive\nis concatenated to the target extraction directory, which
    results in the\nfinal path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance,
    a zip\nmay hold a file with a \\\"../../file.exe\\\" location and thus break out
    of\nthe target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is\noverwritten
    with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn\ninto an arbitrary
    code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a zip archive
    with one benign file and\none malicious file. Extracting the malicous file will
    result in\ntraversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/`\noverwriting
    the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n    \n    +2018-04-15 22:04:29 ..... 19 19 good.txt\n
    \   \n    +2018-04-15 22:04:42 ..... 20 20 ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\n"
