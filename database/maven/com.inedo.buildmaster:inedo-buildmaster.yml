  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [Jenkins Inedo BuildMaster Plugin][1] allows Jenkins to request version
    information and trigger a build on an application in Inedo BuildMaster
    as part of a Jenkins build process.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM) attacks due to unconditionally disabling `SSL/TLS` certificate
    validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM. An Attacker may be able ot
    impersonate any serivce that Jenkins connects to.

  title: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
  description: |
    [com.inedo.buildmaster:inedo-buildmaster][1] is an Inedo BuildMaster
    Plugin.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. The plugin transmits configured credentials in
    plain text as part of the global Jenkins configuration form, potentially
    resulting in their exposure.
