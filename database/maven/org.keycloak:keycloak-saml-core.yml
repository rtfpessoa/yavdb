  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [`org.keycloak:keycloak-saml-core`][1] is an open Source Identity and
    Access Management for modern Applications and Services.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Information Exposure.
    In certain cases, the SAML request parser replaces special strings with
    system properties.

    [org.keycloak:keycloak-saml-core][1] is an access Management for modern
    Applications and Services.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Host Header
    Injection, causing the application to send a poisoned URL as the
    password reset link.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.keycloak:keycloak-saml-core][1] is an Open Source Identity and
    Access Management For Modern Applications and Services.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. While parsing `SAML` messages, the `StaxParserUtil` class
    replaced special strings for obtaining attribute values with system
    property. This could allow an attacker to determine values of system
    properties at the attacked system by formatting the `SAML` request ID
    field to be the chosen system property which could be obtained in the
    `InResponseTo` field in the response.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`org.keycloak:keycloak-saml-core`][1] Affected versions of this package
    are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. It mishandles
    `Logout` requests that contain an `Extension` element, which triggers an
    infinite loop.



    [1]: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22keycloak-saml-core%22
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
