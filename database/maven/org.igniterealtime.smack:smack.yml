  title: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
  description: |
    [org.igniterealtime.smack:smack][1] is a Open Source XMPP (Jabber)
    client library for instant messaging and presence. This library provides
    the client side functionality as specified in the core XMPP
    specifications as related to the client side of said specifications.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficient
    Verification of Data Authenticity. The ParseRoster component in the
    Ignite Realtime Smack XMPP API before 4.0.0-rc1 does not verify the from
    attribute of a roster-query IQ stanza, which allows remote attackers to
    spoof IQ responses via a crafted attribute.

  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [`org.igniterealtime.smack:smack`][1] The Ignite Realtime Smack XMPP API
    4.x before 4.0.2, and 3.x and 2.x when a custom SSLContext is used, does
    not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the
    subject\'s Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509
    certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL
    servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
