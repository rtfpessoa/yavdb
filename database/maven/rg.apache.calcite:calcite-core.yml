  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [rg.apache.calcite:calcite-core][1] is a dynamic data management
    framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM). The `HttpUtils#getURLConnection` method disables explicitly
    hostname verification for HTTPS connections making clients vulnerable to
    man-in-the-middle attacks. Calcite uses this method internally to
    connect with Druid and Splunk so information leakage may happen when
    using the respective Calcite adapters.

    The method itself is in a utility class so people may use it to create
    vulnerable HTTPS connections for other applications.
