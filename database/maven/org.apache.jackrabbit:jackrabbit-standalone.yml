  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [`org.apache.jackrabbit:jackrabbit-standalone`][1] Apache Commons
    HttpClient 3.x, as used in Amazon Flexible Payments Service (FPS)
    merchant Java SDK and other products, does not verify that the server
    hostname matches a domain name in the subject\'s Common Name (CN) or
    subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
    man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid
    certificate.

  title: Insecure Temporary File Creation
  description: |
    [`org.apache.jackrabbit:jackrabbit-standalone`][1] Affected versions of
    the package are vulnerable to Insecure Temporary File Creation. The
    default configuration of javax.servlet.context.tempdir in Apache Commons
    FileUpload 1.0 through 1.2.2 uses the /tmp directory for uploaded files,
    which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via an unspecified
    symlink attack.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`org.apache.jackrabbit:jackrabbit-standalone`][1] MultipartStream.java
    in Apache Commons FileUpload before 1.3.1, as used in Apache Tomcat,
    JBoss Web, and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via a crafted
    Content-Type header that bypasses a loop\'s intended exit conditions.
    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Denial Of Service
    (DoS).

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
