  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). It does not perform permission checks in several HTTP
    endpoints.This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to start
    cascade builds and layout builds, and reconfigure the
    plugin.Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests,
    resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.As of
    publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
