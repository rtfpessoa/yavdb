  title: Insufficient Validation
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:google-closure-library][1] is a powerful, low-level
    JavaScript library designed for building complex and scalable web
    applications. It is used by many Google web applications, such as Google
    Search, Gmail, Google Docs, Google+, Google Maps, and others.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficient
    Validation. A URL parsing issue in goog.uri of the Google Closure
    Library allows an attacker to send malicious URLs to be parsed by the
    library and return the wrong authority.
