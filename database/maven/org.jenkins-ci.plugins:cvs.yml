  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:cvs][1] is a plugin that integrates Jenkins with
    the Concurrent Versions System using a modified version of the Netbeans
    cvsclient.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). CVS Plugin 2.15 and earlier does not require POST
    requests in several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request
    forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities. This allows attackers to create and
    manipulate tags, and to connect to an attacker-specified URL.CVS Plugin
    2.16 now requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.
