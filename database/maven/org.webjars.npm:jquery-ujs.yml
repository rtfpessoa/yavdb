  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:jquery-ujs][1] is an Unobtrusive scripting adapter for
    jQuery

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). It can be used to bypass CSP protections and allows
    attackers to send CSRF tokens to attacker domains. In the scenario where
    an attacker might be able to control the href attribute of an anchor tag
    or the action attribute of a form tag that will trigger a POST action,
    the attacker can set the href or action to \"
    [https://attacker.com\"][2] (note the leading space) that will be passed
    to JQuery, who will see this as a same origin request, and send the
    user\'s CSRF token to the attacker domain.
