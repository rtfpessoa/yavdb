  title: Downloads Resources over HTTP
  description: "Affected versions of `pennyworth` insecurely downloads resources over
    HTTP. \r\n\r\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position,
    they can modify or read such resources at will. While the exact severity of impact
    for a vulnerability like this is highly variable and depends on the behavior of
    the package itself, it ranges from being able to read sensitive information all
    the way up to and including remote code execution."

  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol
  description: |
    [`pennyworth`][1] is a natural language templating engine. Affected
    versions of the package are vulnerable to Man in the Middle (MitM)
    attacks due to downloading resources over an insecure protocol. Without
    a secure connection, it is possible for an attacker to intercept this
    connection and alter the packages received. In serious cases, this may
    even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host server.
