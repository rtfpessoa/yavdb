  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [props][1] is an extract json/yaml from the beginning of text files

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection
    due to Unsafe Deserialization in `props` module. The module uses
    [`yaml-js.load()`][2] function to load a YAML file without any
    validation/sanitization. If an attacker can control the YAML file, it
    could run arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim machine.
