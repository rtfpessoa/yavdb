  title: Local File Inclusion
  description: All versions of `domokeeper` are vulnerable to Local File Inclusion.
    The `/plugin/` route passes a GET parameter unsanitized to a `require()` call.
    It then returns the output of `require()` in the server response. This may allow
    attackers to load unintended code in the application. It also allows attackers
    to exfiltrate information in `.json` files.

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [domokeeper][1] is a pluggable domotic control server for Raspberry Pi
    2/3.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. The path to required module is passed in an HTTP request
    without any sanitisation, thus making it possible to load code that was
    not intended to run on the server. In addition, the fact that output of
    the module is passed to server response directly may cause information
    leakage. For example it is possible to read `package.json` file or any
    other json file.
