  title: Downloads Resources over HTTP
  description: "Affected versions of `ikst` insecurely download resources over HTTP.
    \r\n\r\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, they
    can modify or read such resources at will. While the exact severity of impact
    for a vulnerability like this is highly variable and depends on the behavior of
    the package itself, it ranges from being able to read sensitive information all
    the way up to and including remote code execution."

  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol
  description: |
    [`ikst`][1] Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man in
    the Middle (MitM) attacks due to downloading resources over an insecure
    protocol. Without a secure connection, it is possible for an attacker to
    intercept this connection and alter the packages received. In serious
    cases, this may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host
    server.

    You can read more about `Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol` on
    our [blog][2].

  title: Malicious Package
  description: |+
    `ikst` is a malicious package that was used to collect download metrics
    beyond what npm provides, and sent them to google analytics or piwik.
    This can cause a privacy concern amongst users.

    This is especially dangerous in production runtime environments, where
    environment variables tend to consist of keys, passwords, tokens and
    other secrets.

    Example:

        {
          "name": "npm_scripts_test_metrics",
          "scripts": {
            "preinstall": "curl 'http://google-analytics.com/collect?v=1&t=event&tid=....'",
            "postinstall": "curl 'http://google-analytics.com/collect?v=1&t=event&tid=....'"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "subtitles-lib",
          "scripts": {
            "postinstall": "bash -c 'curl \"http://*****.piwikpro.com/piwik.php?idsite=3&rec=1&action_name=$HOSTNAME\"'"
          }
        }
    {: .language-json}

    The list of packages and their scripts are:

        npm_scripts_test_metrics
        subtitles-lib
        ikst
        botbait
        mktmpio
        anarchy
