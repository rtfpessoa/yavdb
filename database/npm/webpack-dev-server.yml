  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [webpack-dev-server][1] Serves a webpack app.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The origin of requests is not checked by the WebSocket server,
    which is used for HMR. A malicious user could receive the HMR message
    sent by the WebSocket server via a `ws://127.0.0.1:8080/` connection
    from any origin.
