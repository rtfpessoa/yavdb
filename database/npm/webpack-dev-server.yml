    that is used for Hot Module Replacement (HMR) are not validated.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [webpack-dev-server][1] Uses webpack with a development server that
    provides live reloading. It should be used for development only.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The origin of requests is not checked by the WebSocket server,
    which is used for HMR. A malicious user could receive the HMR message
    sent by the WebSocket server via a `ws://127.0.0.1:8080/` connection
    from any origin.
