  title: Insecure Default Configuration
  description: |
    [@graphql-codegen/cli][1] is a CLI client for GraphQL Code Generator
    which can be utilized to generates code out for GraphQL schema.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Default
    Configuration. The `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` environment variable
    is set to the value 0 in all versions of the package disabling
    certificate verification. This flaw can be exploited by a
    Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacker, resulting in an attacker able to view
    a victim\'s HTTPS traffic.

    It should be noted that during the release of graphql-code-generator
    version 1.1.0, the CLI component was amended to be a separate package
    \"@graphql-codegen/cli\".
