  title: Remote Memory Exposure
  description: |
    Versions of `mysql` before 2.14.0 are vulnerable to remove memory exposure.

    Affected versions of `mysql` package allocate and send an uninitialized memory over the network when a number is provided as a password.

    Only `mysql` running on Node.js versions below 6.0.0 is affected due to a throw added in newer node.js versions.

    Proof of Concept:

    ```
    require('mysql').createConnection({
      host: 'localhost',
      user: 'user',
      password : USERPROVIDEDINPUT,  // number
      database : 'my_db'
    }).connect();
    ```

  title: Uninitialized Memory Exposure
  description: |
    [`mysql`][1] is a node.js driver for mysql.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable due to the unsafe use of
    the `Buffer()` method. Uninitialized memory may be exposed when a value
    of type `number` is provided to various methods in `mysql` which require
    allocation of buffers and results in concatenation of uninitialized
    memory to the buffer collection.

    This vulnerability is unlikely to be exploited, but may be possible if a
    server-side `mysql` accepts typed input for passwords from the client
    even though the user doesn’t control the server-side code (i.e through
    JSON format).



    [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql
    \nConstructing a `Buffer` class with integer `N` creates a `Buffer` of
    length `N` with raw (not \"zero-ed\") memory.

    In the following example, the first call would allocate 100 bytes of
    memory, while the second example will allocate the memory needed for the
    string \"100\":

        // uninitialized Buffer of length 100
        x = new Buffer(100);
        // initialized Buffer with value of '100'
        x = new Buffer('100');

    You can read more about the insecure `Buffer` behavior [on our blog][1].

    Similar vulnerabilities were discovered in [request][2], [mongoose][3],
    [ws][4] and [sequelize][5].
