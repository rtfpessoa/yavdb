  title: Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |
    [@knutkirkhorn/free-space][1] is a package that gets the amount of free
    space for a drive.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command
    Execution due to the lack of sanitization of the input parameter of the
    library\'s exported anonymous function. The exported function, when
    given a parameter checks what platform the code is being run on and
    sends that parameter to a function call in either lib/unix.js or
    lib/windows/js. The vulnerability exists in lib/unix.js which directly
    uses the user-input parameter: disk in the template string that
    ultimately gets executed.
