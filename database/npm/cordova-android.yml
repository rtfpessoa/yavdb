  title: Information Exposure
  description: Versions of `cordova-android` prior to 6.0.0 are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure through log files. The application calls methods of the Log class. Messages
    passed to these methods (Log.v(), Log.d(), Log.i(), Log.w(), and Log.e()) are
    stored in a series of circular buffers on the device. By default, a maximum of
    four 16 KB rotated logs are kept in addition to the current log. The logged data
    can be read using Logcat on the device. When using platforms prior to Android
    4.1 (Jelly Bean), the log data is not sandboxed per application; any application
    installed on the device has the capability to read data logged by other applications.

  title: HTTP Whitelist Bypass
  description: |
    [`cordova-android`][1] is an Android application library that allows for
    Cordova-based projects to be built for the Android Platform.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to HTTP Whiteist Bypass.
    This allows remote attackers to bypass the HTTP whitelist and connect to
    arbitrary servers by using JavaScript to open WebSocket connections
    through WebView.

  title: Arbitrary Command Injection
  description: |
    [`cordova-android`][1] is an Android application library that allows for
    Cordova-based projects to be built for the Android Platform.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command
    Injection. Apache Cordova Android before 3.7.2 and 4.x before 4.0.2,
    when an application does not set explicit values in config.xml, allows
    remote attackers to modify undefined secondary configuration variables
    (preferences) via a crafted intent: URL.

  title: Insecure Randomness

    [`cordova-android`][1] is an Android application library that allows for

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness.
    It improperly generates random values for BridgeSecret data, which makes
    it easier for attackers to conduct bridge hijacking attacks by
    predicting a value.

  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol
  description: |
    [cordova-android][1] is an Android application library that allows for
    Cordova-based projects to be built for the Android Platform.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man in the Middle
    (MitM) attacks due to downloading resources over an insecure protocol.

    The build scripts would fetch Gradle using HTTP instead of HTTPS

    Without a secure connection, it is possible for an attacker to intercept
    this connection and alter the packages received. In serious cases, this
    may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host server.
