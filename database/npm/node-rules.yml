  title: Command Injection
  description: Versions of `node-rules` prior to 5.0.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The package fails to sanitize input rules and passes it directly to an `eval`
    call when using the `fromJSON` function. This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary
    code in the system if the rules are user-controlled.

  vulnerable_versions:
  - "<5.0.0"
  severity: high
  package_manager: npm
  cwe: CWE-78
