  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service
  description: |-
    In `redis` before version 3.1.1, when a client is in monitoring mode, the regex begin used to detected monitor messages could cause exponential backtracking on some strings. This issue could lead to a denial of service.

    ### Patches
    The problem was fixed in commit [`2d11b6d`](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node-redis/commit/2d11b6dc9b9774464a91fb4b448bad8bf699629e) and was released in version `3.1.1`.
