  title: Command Injection
  description: All versions of `npm-programmatic ` are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The package fails to sanitize input rules and passes it directly to an `exec`
    call on the `install`, `uninstall` and `list` functions . This may allow attackers
    to execute arbitrary code in the system if the package name passed to the function
    is user-controlled.
