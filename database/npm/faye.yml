  title: Insecure Defaults
  description: |
    [`faye`][1] is a simple pub/sub messaging for the web. Affected versions
    of the package are vulnerable to Man-In-The-Middle attacks due to
    insecure defaults. By default, `faye` used an insecure cipher, allowing
    attackers to gain access to SSL encrypted packets. This attack is also
    known as the BEAST attack.

    You can read more about insecure defaults on our [blog][2]

  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [faye][1] is a simple pub/sub messaging for the web.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). Rosetta Flash (alphanum only swf converter) can be used
    as a callback at a JSONP endpoint, and as a result, send data across
    domains.
