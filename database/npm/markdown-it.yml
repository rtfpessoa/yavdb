  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via Class Injection
  description: |+
    [`markdown-it`][1] is a modern pluggable markdown parser.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS) via Class Injection.

    The markdown-it renderer blindly appends the character class to the
    `language-` part of the tag. If there is a space in the language name,
    it\'ll be rendered into two separate classes.

        \`\`\`
        foo bar
        code
        \`\`\`

    will be rendered into

        <pre><code style="language-foo bar">
        code
        </code></pre>

    A malicious user can attach an arbitrary class to the `code` tag.

    \nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a
    legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as
    originating from a trusted source.

    This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web
    application then delivers that data to its users along with other
    trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly
    executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side
    languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that
    are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.

    ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is
    exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this
    manipulation is the top method for securing code against this
    vulnerability.

    Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and
    particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those
    characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example,
    in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in
    order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while
    within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious
    content is injected into an application that escapes special characters
    and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those
    characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser
    if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this
    way the attempted attack is diverted.

    The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP
    HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to
    expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and
    functionality and deliver malware.

    ### Types of attacks   {#types-of-attacks}

    There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:

    | Type | Origin | Description |
    |----------
    | **Stored** | Server | The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link. |
    | **Reflected** | Server | The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. |
    | **DOM-based** | Client | The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data. |
    | **Mutated** |  | The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters. |

    ### Affected environments   {#affected-environments}

    The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:

    * Web servers
    * Application servers
    * Web application environments

    ### How to prevent   {#how-to-prevent}

    This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically
    protect your code:

    * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back,
      ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing
      anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters
      during searches.
    * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces
      to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.
    * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.
    * Redirect invalid requests.
    * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP
      addresses, and invalidate those sessions.
    * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to
      disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.
    * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your
      code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.

  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via Data URIs
  description: |+
    [markdown-it][1] is a pluggable markdown parser used for rendering
    markdown content to html.

    Affected versions of the package allowed the use of `data:` URIs for all
    mime types by default potentially opening a door for Cross-site
    Scripting (XSS) attacks.

    The fix was introduced in version `4.1.0`, whitelisting the following
    four data types `image/gif`, `image/png`, `image/jpeg` and `image/webp`
    while blocking the others by default.

    Data URIs enable embedding small files in line in HTML documents,
    provided in the URL itself. Attackers can craft malicious web pages
    containing either HTML or script code that utilizes the data URI scheme,
    allowing them to bypass access controls or steal sensitive information.

    An example of data URI used to deliver javascript code. The data holds
    `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` tag in base64 encoded format.

        [xss link](data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4K)

  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
  description: "[markdown-it][1] is a modern pluggable markdown parser.\n\nAffected
    versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression\nDenial of Service
    (ReDoS). Parsing *\\_*{::}*\\**… takes quadratic time,\nthis could be a denial
    of service vulnerability in an application that\nparses user input.\n\n\n\n[1]:
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it\n\\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes
    a family of attacks, all aimed at\nmaking a system inaccessible to its original
    and legitimate users. There\nare many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying
    to clog the network\npipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic
    from many\nmachines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending\ncrafted
    requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional\namount of time
    to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial
    of\nService attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they\naren\\'t
    very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for\nattackers to take
    your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n\n
    \   regex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n{: .language-js}\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes
    the following:\n\n* `A` The string must start with the letter \\'A\\'\n* `(B|C+)+`
    The string must then follow the letter A with either the\n  letter \\'B\\' or
    some number of occurrences of the letter \\'C\\' (the\n  `+` matches one or more
    times). The `+` at the end of this section\n  states that we can look for one
    or more matches of this section.\n* `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the
    string ends with a \\'D\\'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`,
    `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD`\nand `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn\\'t take very
    long for a regex engine to find a\nmatch:\n\n    $ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n
    \   0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n    \n    $ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n
    \   1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n{: .language-bash}\n\nThe entire
    process of testing it against a 30 characters long string\ntakes around ~52ms.
    But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly\ntwo seconds to complete the
    test, over ten times as long as it took to\ntest a valid string. The dramatic
    difference is due to the way regular\nexpressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex
    engines will work very similarly (with minor differences).\nThe engine will match
    the first possible way to accept the current\ncharacter and proceed to the next
    one. If it then fails to match the\nnext one, it will backtrack and see if there
    was another way to digest\nthe previous character. If it goes too far down the
    rabbit hole only to\nfind out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many
    characters\nhave multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps
    can\nbecome very large, resulting in what is known as *catastrophic\nbacktracking*.\n\nLet\\'s
    look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a\nshorter string: \\\"ACCCX\\\".
    While it seems fairly straightforward, there\nare still four different ways that
    the engine could match those three\nC\\'s:\n\n1.  CCC\n2.  CC+C\n3.  C+CC\n4.
    \ C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of
    them\npotentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the\nother
    steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger][1] to\nsee the engine
    has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine\nthe string doesn\\'t
    match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string\njust
    continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C\\'s | Number of steps |\n|----------\n|
    ACCCX | 3 | 38 |\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71 |\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136 |\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX
    | 14 | 65,553 |\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C\\'s, the engine has to
    take over\n65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme\nsituations
    can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to\ninput size, as shown
    above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and\ncan cause the service to excessively
    consume CPU, resulting in a Denial\nof Service.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://regex101.com/debugger\n"
