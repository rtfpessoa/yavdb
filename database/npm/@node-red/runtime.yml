  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: |-
    ### Impact

    Node-RED 1.2.7 and earlier contains a Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the admin API. A badly formed request can modify the prototype of the default JavaScript Object with the potential to affect the default behaviour of the Node-RED runtime.

    ### Workarounds

    A workaround is to ensure only authorised users are able to access the editor url.
