  title: Downloads Resources over HTTP
  description: "Affected versions of `cobalt-cli` insecurely download an executable
    over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \r\n\r\nIn scenarios where an attacker has
    a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace
    the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system
    running `cobalt-cli`."

  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol
  description: |
    [`cobalt-cli`][1] is vulnerable to Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks due
    to downloading resources over an insecure protocol. Without a secure
    connection, it is possible for an attacker to intercept this connection
    and alter the packages received. In serious cases, this may even lead to
    Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host server.
