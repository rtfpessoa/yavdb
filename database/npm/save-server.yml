  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [save-server][1] is an A ShareX server built on Express, Bulma and
    SQLite with User support.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). The attack would require you to navigate to a malicious
    site while you have an active session with Save-Server (Session key
    stored in cookies). The malicious user would then be able to perform
    some actions, including uploading/deleting files and adding redirects.
    If you are logged in as root, this attack is significantly more severe.
    They can in addition create, delete and update users. If they updated
    the password of a user, that user\'s files would then be available. If
    the root password is updated, all files would be visible if they logged
    in with the new password. Note that due to the same origin policy
    malicious actors cannot view the gallery or the response of any of the
    methods, nor be sure they succeeded.
