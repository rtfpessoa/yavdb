  title: Arbitrary Command Injection
  description: |
    [`pidusage`][1] is a package for Cross-platform process cpu % and memory
    usage of a PID. Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to
    Arbitrary Command Injection. It passes user input to
    `child_process.exec` without sanitization, which causes a command
    injection vulnerability in the `ps` function due to never casting the
    PID to an integer.

    PoC:

        var pid = require('pidusage');
        pid.stat('1 && /usr/local/bin/python');
    {: .language-js}
