  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service
  description: Versions of `papaparse` prior to 5.5.2 are vulnerable to Regular Expression
    Denial of Service (ReDos). The `parse` function contains a malformed regular expression
    that takes exponentially longer to process non-numerical inputs. This allows attackers
    to stall systems and lead to Denial of Service.

  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
  description: |
    [papaparse][1] is a fast in-browser CSV (or delimited text) parser for
    JavaScript.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression
    Denial of Service (ReDoS). It is possible to conduct denial of service
    attacks by abusing the RegExp used to detect numbers within the package.
