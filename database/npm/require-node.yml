  description: Versions of `require-node` prior to 1.3.4 for 1.x and 2.0.4 for 2.x
    are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. The package fails to sanitize requests
    to the `require-node` endpoint, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code in
    the server through the injection of OS commands in the request body.

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [require-node][1] is a node middleware let that browser js code can
    require node js code which is still running at node server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. An attacker is able to execute OS commands in the server
    through a crafted request body. This is due to improperly sanitising the
    requests to the `require-node` endpoint.
