  title: Large gzip Denial of Service
  description: "Affected versions of `superagent` do not check the post-decompression
    size of ZIP compressed HTTP responses prior to decompressing. This results in
    the package being vulnerable to a [ZIP bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb)
    attack, where an extremely small ZIP file becomes many orders of magnitude larger
    when decompressed. \n\nThis may result in unrestrained CPU/Memory/Disk consumption,
    causing a denial of service condition."

    [`superagent`][1] is elegant &amp; feature rich browser / node HTTP with

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS) attacks. It uncompresses responses in memory, and a malicious user
    may send a specially crafted zip file which will then unzip in the
    server and cause excessive CPU consumption. This is also known as a `Zip

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
