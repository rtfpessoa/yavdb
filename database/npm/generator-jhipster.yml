  title: Cryptographically Weak PRNG
  description: Versions of `generator-jhipster` use a Cryptographically Weak PRNG
    that may lead to account takeover. The package uses a cryptographically insecure
    method to generate password reset links, which allows an attacker to guess password
    reset links and takeover accounts.

  description: "> The TokenProvider uses String.equals(str) to compare the given token-signature
    with a calculated one. This method uses a break-on-inequality algorithm. This
    makes the TokenProvider vulnerable to timing attacks, where an attacker can forge
    a token with any username more easily than using brute force.\n> \n> -- [github.com](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/2095)"

  title: Mishandled Logout Function
  description: |
    [`generator-jhipster`][1] is a Spring Boot + Angular in one handy
    generator. Affected versions of the package are vulnerable due to the
    mishandling if the logout function in IE8. When an admin logs out, the
    session is not properly cleared and any user logging in afterward will
    have admin permissions. A malicious user could use this to their
    advantage.

    **Note:** This only occurs on IE8.

  title: Insecure Randomness
  description: |
    [generator-jhipster][1] is a development platform to generate, develop
    and deploy Spring Boot + Angular / React / Vue Web applications and
    Spring microservices.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness.
    Uses an insecure source of randomness to generate all of its random
    values as it relies upon apache commons lang3 `RandomStringUtils`. This
    allows an attacker (if able to obtain their own password reset URL) to
    compute the value for all other password resets for other accounts, thus
    allowing privilege escalation or account takeover.
