  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [react-dev-utils][1] includes some utilities used by Create React App.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. On Windows, developers are allowed to run a local webserver
    for accepting various commands, including a command to launch an editor.
    The input to that command was not properly sanitized, allowing an
    attacker who can make a network request to the server (either via CSRF
    or by direct request) to execute arbitrary commands on the targeted
    system.
