  title: CSRF Vulnerability
  description: |-
    Versions 1.0.3 and earlier of jquery-ujs are vulnerable to an information leakage attack that may enable attackers to launch CSRF attacks, as it allows attackers to send CSRF tokens to external domains.

    When an attacker controls the href attribute of an anchor tag, or
    the action attribute of a form tag triggering a POST action, the attacker can set the
    href or action to " https://attacker.com". By prepending a space to the external domain, it causes jQuery to consider it a same origin request, resulting in the user's CSRF token being sent to the external domain.

  description: jquery_ujs.js in jquery-rails before 3.1.3 and 4.x before 4.0.4 and
    rails.js in jquery-ujs before 1.0.4, as used with Ruby on Rails 3.x and 4.x, allow
    remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy, and trigger transmission of
    a CSRF token to a different-domain web server, via a leading space character in
    a URL within an attribute value.

  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    CSRF Vulnerability in jquery-ujs and jquery-rails. There is an
    vulnerability in jquery-ujs and jquery-rails that can be used to bypass
    CSP protections and allows attackers to send CSRF tokens to attacker
    domains.

    \nIn the scenario where an attacker might be able to control the href
    attribute of an anchor tag or the action attribute of a form tag that
    will trigger a POST action, the attacker can set the href or action to
    \" [https://attacker.com\"][1] (note the leading space) that will be
    passed to JQuery, who will see this as a same origin request, and send
    the user\'s CSRF token to the attacker domain.
