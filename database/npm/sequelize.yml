  title: SQL Injection
  description: |-
    Affected versions of `sequelize` cast arrays to strings and fail to properly escape the resulting SQL statement, resulting in a SQL injection vulnerability.


    ## Proof of Concept
    In Postgres, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server there is an issue where arrays are treated as strings and improperly escaped.

    Example Query:
    ```
    database.query('SELECT * FROM TestTable WHERE Name IN (:names)', {
      replacements: {
        names: directCopyOfUserInput
      }
    });
    ```

    If the user inputs the value of `:names` as:
    ```
    ["test", "'); DELETE TestTable WHERE Id = 1 --')"]
    ```

    The resulting SQL statement will be:
    ```
    SELECT Id FROM Table WHERE Name IN ('test', '\'); DELETE TestTable WHERE Id = 1 --')
    ```
    As the backslash has no special meaning in PostgreSQL, MSSQL, or SQLite, the statement will delete the record in TestTable with an Id of 1.

  title: Hash Injection
  description: |
    [sequelize][1] is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL,
    MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Hash Injection.
    Using specially crafted requests an attacker can bypass `secret_token`
    protections on websites using sequalize.

    For example:

        db.Token.findOne({
              where: {
                token: req.query.token
              }
        );

    Node.js and other platforms allow nested parameters, i.e. `token[$gt]=1`
    will be transformed into `token = {"$gt":1}`. When such a hash is passed
    into `sequalize` it will consider it a query (greater than 1) and find
    the first token in the DB, bypassing security of this endpoint.

    such as code, runtime memory and user data into\nthe database.\n\n### Details
    \  {#details}\n\n`sequelize` uses the `Buffer` type to represent `DataTypes.BLOB`.\nInitializing
    a `Buffer` with integer `N` creates a `Buffer` of length\n`N` with non zero-ed
    out memory. **Example:**\n\n    var x = new Buffer(100); // uninitialized Buffer
    of length 100\n    // vs\n    var x = new Buffer('100'); // initialized Buffer
    with value of '100'\n\nInitializing a `BLOB` field in such manner will dump uninitialized\nmemory
    into the database. The patch wraps `Buffer` field initialization\nin sequelize
    by converting a `number` value `N` to a string,\ninitializing the `Buffer` with
    `N` in its ascii form.\n\n#### Proof of concept   {#proof-of-concept}\n\n    var

  title: SQL Injection via GeoJSON
  description: |
    `sequelize` versions prior to `3.23.6` are vulnerable to SQL injection
    via [GeoJSON][1] documents that contain a value with a single quote.
    GeoJSON is a format used for encoding a variety of geographic data
    structures in a standard JSON document. The vulnerability exists within
    GeoJSON documents using the function `ST_GeomFromGeoJSON` (for
    postgresql/postgis) and the function `GeomFromText` (for mysql).

    Note that `sequelize` users who do not use these specific functions are
    not affected. For users who do use these functions, this vulnerability
    has a high impact and is easily expoited, hence its high severity
    classification.
