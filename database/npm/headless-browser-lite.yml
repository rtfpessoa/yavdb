    attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response
    and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on

  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol
  description: |
    [`headless-browser-lite`][1] is a minimal npm installer for phantomjs
    and slimerjs with no external dependencies.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man in the Middle
    (MitM) attacks due to downloading resources over an insecure protocol.
    Without a secure connection, it is possible for an attacker to intercept
    this connection and alter the packages received. In serious cases, this
    may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host server.
