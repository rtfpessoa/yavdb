  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [webpack-subresource-integrity][1] is a Webpack plugin for enabling
    Subresource Integrity

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. All dynamically loaded chunks receive an invalid integrity hash
    that is ignored by the browser, and therefore the browser cannot
    validate their integrity. This removes the additional level of
    protection offered by SRI for such chunks. Top-level chunks are
    unaffected.
