  title: Header Forgery
  description: "Affected versions of `http-signature` contain a vulnerability which
    can allow an attacker in a privileged network position to modify header names
    and change the meaning of the request, without requiring an updated signature.
    \n\nThis problem occurs because vulnerable versions of `http-signature` sign the
    contents of headers, but not the header names.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nConsider
    this to be the initial, untampered request:\n```\nPOST /pay HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nDate:
    Thu, 05 Jan 2012 21:31:40 GMT\nX-Payment-Source: src@money.com\nX-Payment-Destination:
    dst@money.com\nAuthorization: Signature keyId=\"Test\",algorithm=\"rsa-sha256\",headers=\"x-payment-source
    x-payment-destination\" MDyO5tSvin5...\n```\n\nAnd the request is intercepted
    and tampered as follows:\n```\nX-Payment-Source: dst@money.com // Emails switched\nX-Payment-Destination:
    src@money.com\nAuthorization: Signature keyId=\"Test\",algorithm=\"rsa-sha256\",headers=\"x-payment-destination
    x-payment-source\" MDyO5tSvin5...\n```\n\nIn the resulting responses, both requests
    would pass signature verification without issue.\n```\nsrc@money.com\\n\ndst@money.com\\n\n```\n"

  title: Unsigned Request Headers
  description: |
    [`http-signature`][1] is a Reference implementation of Joyent\'s HTTP
    Signature scheme. Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to
    header forgery, due to the header names not being signed. An attacker
    could switch the header list order and header value order ending up wit
    the same signature for two separate requests.

  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [`http-signature`][1] is a reference implementation of Joyent\'s HTTP
    Signature scheme.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Timing Attacks due to
    time-variable comparison of signatures.

    The library implemented a character to character comparison, similar to
    the built-in string comparison mechanism, `===`, and not a time constant
    string comparison. As a result, the comparison will fail faster when the
    first characters in the signature are incorrect. An attacker can use
    this difference to perform a timing attack, essentially allowing them to
    guess the signature one character at a time.

    You can read more about timing attacks in Node.js on the [Snyk blog][2].
