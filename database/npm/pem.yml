  title: Sensitive Data Exposure
  description: "Versions of `pem` before 1.13.2 expose sensitive data when the `readPkcs12`
    is used. \n\nThe `readPkcs12` function reads the certificate and key data from
    a pkcs12 file using the encryption password. As part of this process it creates
    a globally readable file with a filename of 20 random 0-f characters in the temporary
    directory containing the password which is then read by OpenSSL. The file containing
    the password is never cleaned up after it is used giving access to the pkcs12
    password to any other users with access to read files from the system.\n"

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [pem][1] is a package to create private keys and certificates with
    node.js.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The package exposes sensitive data when the `readPkcs12` is
    used.

    The `readPkcs12` function reads the certificate and key data from a
    pkcs12 file using the encryption password. As part of this process it
    creates a globally readable file with a filename of 20 random 0-f
    characters in the temporary directory containing the password which is
    then read by OpenSSL. The file containing the password is never cleaned
    up after it is used giving access to the pkcs12 password to any other
    users with access to read files from the system.
