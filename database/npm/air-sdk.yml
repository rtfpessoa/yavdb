  title: Downloads Resources over HTTP
  description: "Affected versions of `air-sdk` insecurely download an executable over
    an unencrypted HTTP connection. \r\n\r\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged
    network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the executable
    with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `air-sdk`."

  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol
  description: |
    [`air-sdk`][1] is a NPM wrapper for the Adobe AIR SDK.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man in the Middle
    (MitM) attacks due to downloading resources over an insecure protocol.
    Without a secure connection, it is possible for an attacker to intercept
    this connection and alter the packages received. In serious cases, this
    may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host server.
