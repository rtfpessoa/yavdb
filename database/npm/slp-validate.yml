  title: Validation Bypass
  description: Versions of `slp-validate` prior to 1.0.1 are vulnerable to a validation
    bypass. Bitcoin scripts may cause the validation result from `slp-validate` to
    differ from the specified SLP consensus. This allows an attacker to create a Bitcoin
    script that causes a hard-fork from the SLP consensus.

  - "<1.0.1"

  title: Inadequate Encryption Strength
  description: |
    [slp-validate][1] is a Lightweight SLP validator with pre-broadcast
    validation and burn protection.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Inadequate
    Encryption Strength. A specially crafted Bitcoin script can cause a
    discrepancy between the specified SLP consensus rules and the validation
    result. An attacker can create a specially crafted Bitcoin script in
    order to cause a hard-fork from the SLP consensus.

  title: Improper Validation
  description: |
    [slp-validate][1] is a Lightweight SLP validator with pre-broadcast
    validation and burn protection.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Validation.
    Users could experience false-negative validation outcomes for MINT
    transaction operations. A poorly implemented SLP wallet could allow
    spending of the affected tokens which would result in the destruction of
    a user\'s minting baton.

  title: Incorrect Comparison
  description: |
    [slp-validate][1] is a Lightweight SLP validator with pre-broadcast
    validation and burn protection.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Incorrect
    Comparison. There is a vulnerability to false-positive validation
    outcomes for the NFT1 Child Genesis transaction type. A poorly
    implemented SLP wallet or opportunistic attacker could create a
    seemingly valid NFT1 child token without burning any of the NFT1 Group
    token type as is required by the NFT1 specification.
