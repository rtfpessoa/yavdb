  title: Improper Authentication
  description: |
    [express-laravel-passport][1] is a small middleware support getting
    user\_id from Bearer header with laravel structure database

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authentication. The module defined to handle authentication but does not
    validate the JWT token sent by the user. Therefore it allows modifying
    payload within the token. It provides an opportunity to forge the
    user\'s identity by changing the information inside the token\'s payload
    that is used to authenticate the client.
