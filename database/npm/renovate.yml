  title: Sensitive Data Exposure
  description: Applies to Azure DevOps users only. The bot's token may be exposed
    in server or pipeline logs due to the `http.extraheader=AUTHORIZATION` parameter
    being logged without redaction. It is recommended that Azure DevOps users revoke
    their existing bot credentials and generate new ones after upgrading if there's
    a potential that logs have been saved to a location that others can view.
