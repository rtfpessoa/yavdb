  title: Downloads Resources over HTTP
  description: |-
    imageoptim is a Node.js wrapper for some images compression algorithms.

    imageoptim downloads zipped resources over HTTP, which leaves it vulnerable to MITM attacks.  It may be possible to cause remote code execution (RCE) by swapping out the requested tarball with an attacker controlled tarball if the attacker is on the network or positioned in between the user and the remote server.

  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol
  description: |
    [`imageoptim`][1] is a Node.js wrapper for some images compression
    algorithms.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man in the Middle
    (MitM) attacks due to downloading resources over an insecure protocol.
    Without a secure connection, it is possible for an attacker to intercept
    this connection and alter the packages received. In serious cases, this
    may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host server.
