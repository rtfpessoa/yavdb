  title: Arbitrary File Write
  description: |-
    Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Write. It fails to prevent access to folders outside of the intended node_modules folder through the bin field. A properly constructed entry in the package.json bin field would allow a package publisher to create files on a user's system when the package is installed. It is only possible to affect files that the user running `npm install` has access to and it is not possible to over write files that already exist on disk.

    This behavior is still possible through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.

  title: npm Token Leak
  description: |+
    This vulnerability could cause the unintentional leakage of bearer
    tokens. A design flaw in npm\'s registry allows an attacker to set up an
    HTTP server that could collect authentication information, and then use
    this authentication information to impersonate the users whose tokens
    they collected. The attacker could do anything the compromised users
    could do, including publishing new versions of packages.

    \nThe primary npm registry has, since late 2014, used HTTP bearer tokens
    to authenticate requests from the npm command-line interface. Due to a
    design flaw in the CLI, these bearer tokens were sent with every request
    made by logged-in users, regardless of the destination of the request.
    (The bearers only should have been included for requests made against a
    registry or registries used for the current install.)

    This flaw allows an attacker to set up an HTTP server that could collect
    authentication information. They could then use this information to
    impersonate the users whose tokens they collected. This impersonation
    would allow them to do anything the compromised users could do,
    including publishing new versions of packages.

    With the fixes npm have released, the CLI will only send bearer tokens
    with requests made against a registry. npm’s CLI team believe that the
    fix won’t break any existing registry setups. However, it’s possible the
    change will be breaking in some cases, due to the large number of
    registry software suites used.

  title: Arbitrary File Overwrite

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Overwrite. It fails to prevent existing globally-installed binaries to
    be overwritten by other package installations. For example, if a package
    was installed globally and created a `serve` binary, any subsequent
    installs of packages that also create a `serve` binary would overwrite
    the first binary. This only affects files in `/usr/local/bin`.

    For `npm`, this behaviour is still allowed in local installations and
    also through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using
    the `--ignore-scripts` install option.
