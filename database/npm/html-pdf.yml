  title: Arbitrary File Read
  description: All versions of `html-pdf` are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read. The
    package fails to sanitize the HTML input, allowing attackers to exfiltrate server
    files by supplying malicious HTML code. XHR requests in the HTML code are executed
    by the server. Input with an XHR request such as `request.open("GET","file:///etc/passwd")`
    will result in a PDF document with the contents of `/etc/passwd`.
