  title: SSL Validation Defaults to False
  description: "Affected versions of `electron-packager` configure the generated application
    to disable SSL certificate verification by default. \n\nThis could allow an attacker
    with a privileged network position to launch a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack
    on the install process, intercepting the step where electron-packager downloads
    Electron for supported target platforms and architectures, and replacing the valid
    download with a tampered malicious one.\n\nThis only affects users using the electron-packager
    CLI. The strict-ssl option defaults to true for the node.js API."

  title: SSL Validation disabled by default
  description: |+
    `electron-packager` is a command line tool that lets you package and
    distribute your Electron app with OS-specific bundles (.app, .exe etc)
    via JS or CLI.

    Versions `5.2.1-6.0.2` have the `--strict-ssl` command line option
    default to false (causing strict-ssl to not be enabled). This could
    allow an attacker to execute a SSL Man In The Middle attack and deliver
    a malicious electron version that also gets cached in `~/.electron`
    folder.
