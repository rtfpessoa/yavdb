  title: Malicious Package
  description: 'All versions of `smartsearchwp` contain malicious code. The package
    is malware intended to steal credentials from websites it is loaded in. It traverses
    DOM elements looking for fields such as `username` and `password` and uploads
    it to a remote server. The package also port-scans the local gateway and uploads
    the information to the remote server. It has a feature to fetch commands from
    the remote server and execute them with `eval`. The npm security team analysis
    found several bugs in the malware that prevent it from actually performing its
    actions. The malicious code is also not invoked upon installation or require;
    it would require transpiling TypeScript code and using it in a website.
