  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: All versions of `upmerge` are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The
    merge() function fails to prevent user input to alter an Object's prototype, allowing
    attackers to modify override properties of all objects in the application. This
    may lead to Denial of Service or may be chained with other vulnerabilities leading
    to Remote Code Execution.

  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: "[upmerge][1] is a JavaScript Object Merge and Clone for Client or
    Server\nside.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype
    Pollution.\nAn attacker could inject properties on `Object.prototype`.\n\n\n\n[1]:
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/upmerge\n\\nPrototype Pollution is a vulnerability
    affecting JavaScript. Prototype\nPollution refers to the ability to inject properties
    into existing\nJavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript\nallows
    all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical\nattributes such
    as `_proto_`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker\nmanipulates these attributes
    to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript\napplication object prototype of the base
    object by injecting other\nvalues. Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then
    inherited by all\nthe JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that
    happens,\nthis leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript\nexceptions,
    or it tampers with the application source code to force the\ncode path that the
    attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code\nexecution.\n\nThere are two
    main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n* Unsafe `Object` recursive
    merge\n\n* Property definition by path\n\n### Unsafe Object recursive merge   {#unsafe-object-recursive-merge}\n\nThe
    logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following\nhigh-level
    model:\n\n    merge (target, source)\n    \n    foreach property of source\n    \n
    \   if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n    \n
    \   merge(target[property], source[property])\n    \n    else\n    \n    target[property]
    = source[property]\n\n\n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `_proto_`
    defined with\n`Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property\nexists
    and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the\nmerge recurses
    with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the\nsource of `Object` as
    defined by the attacker. Properties are then\ncopied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone
    operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges,\nwhich occur when
    a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object:\n`merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash`
    and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive\nmerge attacks.\n\n###
    Property definition by path   {#property-definition-by-path}\n\nThere are a few
    JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property\nvalues on an object based
    on a given path. The function that is\ngenerally affected contains this signature:
    `theFunction(object, path,\nvalue)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of
    “path”, they can set this value\nto `_proto_.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned
    to the prototype of the\nclass of the object.\n\n"
