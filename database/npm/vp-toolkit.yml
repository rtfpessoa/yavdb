  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [vp-toolkit][1] is a TypeScript/JavaScript API generating and signing
    w3c verifiable credentials and related objects.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. The `verifyVerifiableCredential()` method checks the
    cryptographic integrity of the Verifiable Credential, but it does not
    check if the `credential.issuer` matches the signer of the credential.
