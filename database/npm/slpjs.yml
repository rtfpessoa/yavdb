  title: Improper Validation
  description: |
    [slpjs][1] is a JavaScript Library for validating and building Simple
    Ledger Protocol (SLP) token transactions

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Validation.
    Users could experience false-negative validation outcomes for MINT
    transaction operations. A poorly implemented SLP wallet could allow
    spending of the affected tokens which would result in the destruction of
    a user\'s minting baton.
