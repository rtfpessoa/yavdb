  title: Inadequate Encryption Strength
  description: |
    [slpjs][1] is a JavaScript Library for validating and building Simple
    Ledger Protocol (SLP) token transactions

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Inadequate
    Encryption Strength. A specially crafted Bitcoin script can cause a
    discrepancy between the specified SLP consensus rules and the validation
    result An attacker can create a specially crafted Bitcoin script in
    order to cause a hard-fork from the SLP consensus.

  title: Improper Validation
  description: |
    [slpjs][1] is a JavaScript Library for validating and building Simple
    Ledger Protocol (SLP) token transactions

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Validation.
    Users could experience false-negative validation outcomes for MINT
    transaction operations. A poorly implemented SLP wallet could allow
    spending of the affected tokens which would result in the destruction of
    a user\'s minting baton.

  title: Incorrect Comparison
  description: |
    [slpjs][1] is a JavaScript Library for validating and building Simple
    Ledger Protocol (SLP) token transactions

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Incorrect
    Comparison. There is a vulnerability to false-positive validation
    outcomes for the NFT1 Child Genesis transaction type. A poorly
    implemented SLP wallet or opportunistic attacker could create a
    seemingly valid NFT1 child token without burning any of the NFT1 Group
    token type as is required by the NFT1 specification.
