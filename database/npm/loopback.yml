  title: Improper Authorization
  description: Vulnerable versions of `loopback` may allow attackers to create Authentication
    Tokens on behalf of other users due to Improper Authorization. If the AccessToken
    model is publicly exposed, an attacker can create Authorization Tokens for any
    user as long as they know the target's `userId`. This will allow the attacker
    to access the user's data and their privileges.

  title: Sensitive Data Exposure
  description: Versions of `loopback` prior to 3.26.0 (3.x) and 2.42.0 (2.x) are vulnerable
    to Sensitive Data Exposure. Invalid API requests to the login endpoint may return
    information about the first user in the database. This can be used alongside other
    attacks for credential theft.

  title: SQL Injection
  description: |
    [loopback][1] is a highly-extensible, open-source Node.js framework that
    enables you to create dynamic end-to-end REST APIs, access data from
    several databases, incorporate model relationships and access controls
    for complex APIs, and more.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL Injection. It is
    possible to send queries using the username and email fields in the
    `/Users/login` path, allowing sensitive user information to be
    compromised.

    e.g.

        {
            "email": {"regexp": "^a" },
            "password": "anything you want"
        }
