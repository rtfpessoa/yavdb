  title: Forced Logout
  description: Versions of `keycloak-connect` prior to 4.4.0 are vulnerable to Forced
    Logout. The package fails to validate JWT signatures on the `/k_logout` route,
    allowing attackers to logout users and craft malicious JWTs with NBF values that
    prevent user access indefinitely.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [keycloak-connect][1] is an Identity and Access Management solution for
    modern Applications and Services.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). The Node.js adapter did not properly verify the web token
    received from the server. An attacker with local access could use this
    to construct a malicious web token setting an NBF parameter that could
    prevent user access indefinitely.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
