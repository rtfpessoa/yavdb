  title: Server-Side Request Forgery
  description: All versions of `html-pdf-chrome` are vulnerable to Server-Side Request
    Forgery (SSRF). The package executes HTTP requests if the parsed HTML contains
    external references to resources, such as `<iframe src="http://localhost" height="800px"
    width="800px"></iframe>`. This allows attackers to access resources through HTTP
    that are accessible to the server, including private resources in the hosting
    environment.
