  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [react-native-fast-image][1] is a FastImage, performant React Native
    image component.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. When an image with `source={{uri: "...", headers: { host:
    "somehost.com", authorization: "..." }}` is loaded, all other subsequent
    images will use the same headers, this can lead to signing credentials
    or other session tokens being leaked to other servers.
