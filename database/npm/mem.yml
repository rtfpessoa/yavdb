  title: Denial of Service
  description: Versions of `mem` prior to 4.0.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS).  The package fails to remove old values from the cache even after a value
    passes its `maxAge` property. This may allow attackers to exhaust the system's
    memory if they are able to abuse the application logging.

    [mem][1] is an optimization used to speed up consecutive function calls
    by caching the result of calls with identical input.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). Old results were deleted from the cache and could cause a memory
    leak.
