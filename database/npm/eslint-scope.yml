    [`eslint-scope`][1] is the ECMAScript scope analyzer used in ESLint.

    Version 3.7.2 was identified as malicious after a possible npm account
    takeover. During installation, the malicious code download code from
    `pastebin.com`, then executed it. It sent the contents of the user’s
    `.npmrc` file to the attacker, which typically contains access tokens
    for publishing to npm.
