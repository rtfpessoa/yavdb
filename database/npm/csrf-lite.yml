  title: Timing Attack
  description: "Affected versions of `csrf-lite` are vulnerable to timing attacks
    as a result of testing CSRF tokens via a fail-early comparison instead of a constant-time
    comparison. \n\nTiming attacks remove the exponential increase in entropy gained
    from increased secret length, by providing per-character feedback on the correctness
    of a guess via miniscule timing differences.\n\nUnder favorable network conditions,
    an attacker can exploit this to guess the secret in no more than (16*18)288 guesses,
    instead of the 16^18 guesses required were the timing attack not present. "

  title: Non-Constant Time String Comparison
  description: |
    [`csrf-lite`][1] is a CSRF protection utility for framework-free node
    sites. Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to a timing
    attack.

    While the CSRF protection itself works well and increases security, the
    library uses the built-in string comparison mechanism, `===`, and not a
    time constant string comparison. As a result, the comparison will fail
    faster when the first characters in the token are incorrect. An attacker
    can use this difference to perform a timing attack, essentially allowing
    them to guess the CSRF token one character at a time.

    You can read more about timing attacks in Node.js on the Snyk blog:
