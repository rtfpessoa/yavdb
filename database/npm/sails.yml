  title: Broken CORS
  description: "Affected versions of `sails` have an issue with the CORS configuration
    where the value of the origin header is reflected as the value for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
    header. This may allow an attacker to make AJAX requests to vulnerable hosts through
    cross-site scripting or a malicious HTML Document, effectively bypassing the Same
    Origin Policy. \n\n## Mitigating Factors\n\nThis is only an issue when `allRoutes`
    is set to `true` and `origin` is set to `*` or left commented out in the sails
    CORS config file. \n\nThe problem can be compounded when the cors `credentials`
    setting is not provided, because at that point authenticated cross domain requests
    are possible."

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`sails`][1] is API-driven framework for building realtime apps, using
    MVC conventions (based on Express and Socket.io). Affected versions of
    the package are vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.



    [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/sails
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

    [`sails`][1] is API-driven framework for building realtime apps, using
    MVC conventions (based on Express and Socket.io). Affected versions of
    the package are vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by
    sending an OPTIONS request for an undefined route, emitted on the
    socket.io REST interface. This causes `sails` to become unresponsive.
