  title: Sandbox Breakout / Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: All versions of `veval` are vulnerable to Sandbox Escape leading to
    Remote Code Execution. The package fails to restrict access to the main context
    through `this.constructor.constructor` . This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary
    code in the system. Evaluating the payload `this.constructor.constructor('return
    process.env')()` prints the contents of `process.env`.
