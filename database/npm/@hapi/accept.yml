  title: Denial of Service
  description: Versions of `@hapi/accept` prior to 3.2.4 or 5.0.1 are vulnerable to
    Denial of Service. The Accept-Encoding HTTP header parser has a vulnerability
    which will cause the function to throw a system error if the header contains some
    invalid values. Because hapi rethrows system errors (as opposed to catching expected
    application errors), the error is thrown all the way up the stack. If no unhandled
    exception handler is available, the application will exist, allowing an attacker
    to shut down services.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [@hapi/accept][1] is a HTTP Accept-\* headers parsing library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). Accept-Encoding HTTP header parser has a vulnerability which will
    cause the function to throw a system error if the header contains some
    invalid values. Because hapi rethrows system errors (as opposed to
    catching expected application errors), the error is thrown all the way
    up the stack. If no unhandled exception handler is available, the
    application will exist, allowing an attacker to shut down services.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
