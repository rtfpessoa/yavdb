  title: Denial of Service
  description: Versions of `@hapi/hapi` prior to 18.4.1 or 19.1.1 are vulnerable to
    Denial of Service. The CORS request handler has a vulnerability which will cause
    the function to throw a system error if the header contains some invalid values.
    If no unhandled exception handler is available, the application will exist, allowing
    an attacker to shut down services.

  - ">=19.0.0 <19.1.1"
