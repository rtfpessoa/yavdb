  title: Uninitialized Memory Exposure
  description: |+
    [base64-url][1] Base64 encode, decode, escape and unescape for URL
    applications.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Uninitialized Memory
    Exposure. An attacker may extract sensitive data from uninitialized
    memory or may cause a DoS by passing in a large number, in setups where
    typed user input can be passed (e.g. from JSON).

    \nThe Buffer class on Node.js is a mutable array of binary data, and can
    be initialized with a string, array or number.

        const buf1 = new Buffer([1,2,3]);
        // creates a buffer containing [01, 02, 03]
        const buf2 = new Buffer('test');
        // creates a buffer containing ASCII bytes [74, 65, 73, 74]
        const buf3 = new Buffer(10);
        // creates a buffer of length 10
    {: .language-js}

    The first two variants simply create a binary representation of the
    value it received. The last one, however, pre-allocates a buffer of the
    specified size, making it a useful buffer, especially when reading data
    from a stream. When using the number constructor of Buffer, it will
    allocate the memory, but will not fill it with zeros. Instead, the
    allocated buffer will hold whatever was in memory at the time. If the
    buffer is not `zeroed` by using `buf.fill(0)`, it may leak sensitive
    information like keys, source code, and system info.
