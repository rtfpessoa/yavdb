  title: Command Injection
  description: All versions of `gitting` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The
    package fails to sanitize input and passes it directly to an `exec` call, which
    may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system. The `pull` function
    is vulnerable through the `branch` variable.
