    over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \r\n\r\nIn scenarios where an attacker has
    a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace
    the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system

  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol
  description: |
    [`wixtoolset`][1] is a Node module wrapper around the wixtoolset
    binaries.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man in the Middle
    (MitM) attacks due to downloading resources over an insecure protocol.
    Without a secure connection, it is possible for an attacker to intercept
    this connection and alter the packages received. In serious cases, this
    may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host server.
