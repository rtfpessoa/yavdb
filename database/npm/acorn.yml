  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service
  description: Affected versions of `acorn` are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial
    of Service. A regex in the form of `/[x-\ud800]/u` causes the parser to enter
    an infinite loop. The string is not valid UTF16 which usually results in it being
    sanitized before reaching the parser. If an application processes untrusted input
    and passes it directly to `acorn`, attackers may leverage the vulnerability leading
    to Denial of Service.
