  title: NoSQL Injection
  description: |+
    Versions of `loopback-connector-mongodb` before 3.6.0 are vulnerable to NoSQL injection.

    MongoDB Connector for LoopBack fails to properly sanitize a filter passed to query the database by allowing the dangerous `$where` property to be passed to the MongoDB Driver. The Driver allows the special `$where` property in a filter to execute JavaScript (client can pass in a malicious script) on the database Driver. This is an [intended feature of MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/server-side-javascript/) unless disabled ([instructions here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/server-side-javascript/#disable-server-side-js)).

    A proof of concept malicious query:

    ```
    GET /POST filter={"where": {"$where": "function(){sleep(5000); return this.title.contains('Hello');}"}}
    ```

    The above makes the database sleep for 5 seconds and then returns all “Posts” with the title containing the word `Hello`.

  title: SQL Injection
  description: |
    [loopback-connector-mongodb][1] is the official MongoDB connector for
    the LoopBack framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL Injection.
    Improper sanitising of filters passed to the database query, may cause
    code execution on the database driver and may also lead to data leakage.
