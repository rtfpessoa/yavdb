  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [pixl-class][1] is a library that allows you to create classes in a more
    classical sort of way, including support for static class members,
    proper constructors, inheritance, and mixins.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. The injection point is located in `line 26` in the index file
    `class.js`; the members argument of the create function can be
    controlled by users without any sanitization.
