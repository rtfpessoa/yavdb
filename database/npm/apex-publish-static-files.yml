  title: Arbitrary Command Injection
  description: |
    [apex-publish-static-files][1] Uploads all files from a local directory
    to Oracle APEX.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command
    Injection. It does not sanitize the `connectionString` argument, and
    subsequently passes it to `execSync()`, thus allowing arbitrary shell
    command injection.
