  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: |
    [url-parse][1] is a Small footprint URL parser that works seamlessly
    across Node.js and browser environments.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation. When using `url-parse` in the browser the protocol of the
    URL returned by the parser is not validated correctly. In the Node.js
    environment strings like, `javascript:` return empty strings on the
    resulting URL object, but in the browser `document.location.protocol` is
    used when the provided URL doesn\'t match the validation expression
    `/^([a-z][a-z0-9.+-]*:)?(\/\/)?([\S\s]*)/i`.
