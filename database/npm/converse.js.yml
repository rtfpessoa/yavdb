  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [converse.js][1]is a web based XMPP/Jabber instant messaging client.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. It allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
    because it is too difficult to determine whether safe publication of
    private data was configured or even intended. For example, users might
    have an expectation that chatroom bookmarks are private, but the various
    interacting software components do not necessarily make that happen.

  title: User Impersonation
  description: |
    [converse.js][1] is a web based XMPP/Jabber chat client.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to User Impersonation.
    An incorrect implementation of \"XEP-0280: Message Carbons\" in multiple
    XMPP clients allows a remote attacker to impersonate any user, including
    contacts, in the vulnerable application\'s display. This allows for
    various kinds of social engineering attacks.
