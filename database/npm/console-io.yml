  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: 'Affected versions of the `console-io` package do not configure the
    underlying websocket library to require authentication, resulting in an authentication
    bypass vulnerability. As `console-io` allows terminal access on the server via
    a web page, an authentication bypass is essentially remote code execution.
