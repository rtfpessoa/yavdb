  description: |
    [karma-mojo][1] is a plugin for Karma that provides a binary for running
    only a select subset of tests at a time instead of running the whole
    test suite.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The argument `config` can be controlled by users without any
    sanitization.
