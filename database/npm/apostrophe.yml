  description: Versions of `apostrophe` prior to 2.97.1 are vulnerable to Denial of
    Service. The `apostrophe-jobs` module sets a callback for incoming jobs and doesn't
    clear it regardless of its status. This causes the server to accumulate callbacks,
    allowing an attacker to start a large number of jobs and exhaust system memory.

    [apostrophe][1] is a content management system (CMS) for Node.js. It
    supports in-context editing, schema-driven content types, flexible
    widgets and a great deal more. This module contains everything necessary
    to build a website with ApostropheCMS.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect. It
    was possible to convince Apostrophe to redirect to a third-party website
    by appending an escaped URL with a trailing `/` added at the end.

    [apostrophe][1] is a content management system (CMS) for Node.js. It
    supports in-context editing, schema-driven content types, flexible
    widgets and a great deal more. This module contains everything necessary
    to build a website with ApostropheCMS.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). The `apostrophe-jobs` module sets a callback for incoming jobs
    and doesn\'t clear it regardless of its status. This causes the server
    to accumulate callbacks, allowing an attacker to start a large number of
    jobs and exhaust system memory.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
