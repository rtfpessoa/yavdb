  title: Cryptographically Weak PRNG
  description: All versions of `generator-jhipster-kotlin` use a Cryptographically
    Weak PRNG that may lead to account takeover. The package uses a cryptographically
    insecure method to generate password reset links, which allows an attacker to
    guess password reset links and takeover accounts.

  title: Insecure Randomness
  description: |
    [generator-jhipster-kotlin][1]adds Kotlin to the JHipster application.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness.
    Uses an insecure source of randomness to generate all of its random
    values as it relies upon apache commons lang3 `RandomStringUtils`. This
    allows an attacker (if able to obtain their own password reset URL) to
    compute the value for all other password resets for other accounts, thus
    allowing privilege escalation or account takeover.
