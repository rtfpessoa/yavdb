  title: Insecure Defaults Allow MITM Over TLS
  description: "Affected versions of `engine.io-client` do not verify certificates
    by default, and as such may be vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks.\n\nThe
    vulnerability is related to the way that node.js handles the `rejectUnauthorized`
    setting. If the value is something that evaluates to false, such as undefined
    or null, certificate verification will be disabled. \n"

  title: Insecure Defaults
  description: |
    [engine.io-client][1], the client for [engine.io][2] and [socket.io][3],
    disables the core SSL/TLS verification checks by default.

    This allows an active attacker, for instance one operating a malicious
    WiFi, to intercept these encrypted connections using the attacker\'s
    spoofed certificate and keys. Doing so compromises the data communicated
    over this channel, as well as allowing an attacker to impersonate both
    the server and the client during the live session, sending spoofed data
    to either side.
