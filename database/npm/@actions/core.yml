  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: |
    [@actions/core][1] is a package that provides core functions for setting
    results, logging, registering secrets and exporting variables across
    actions.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation. `addPath` and `exportVariable` functions communicate with
    the Actions Runner over stdout by generating a string in a specific
    format. Workflows that log untrusted data to stdout may invoke these
    commands, resulting in the path or environment variables being modified
    without the intention of the workflow or action author. The runner will
    release an update that disables the `set-env` and `add-path` workflow
    commands in the near future.
