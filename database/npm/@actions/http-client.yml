  title: Information Disclosure
  description: |
    [@actions/http-client][1] is a actions-http-client.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Disclosure. Actions Http-Client can disclose Authorization headers to
    incorrect domain in certain redirect scenarios. The conditions in which
    this happens are if consumers of the http-client:

    1.  make an http request with an authorization header
    2.  that request leads to a redirect (302) and
    3.  the redirect url redirects to another domain or hostname

    Then the authorization header will get passed to the other domain.
