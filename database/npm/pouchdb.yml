  title: Safely allocate attachment buffers in PouchDB/Node.js
  description: "> Due to [Buffer (number) is unsafe](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/4660)
    in Node and PouchDB's usage of the now-deprecated [Buffer(number) constructor](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v4.x/docs/api/buffer.html#buffer_new_buffer_size)
    for attachments, PouchDB attachment buffers allocate potentially uninitialized
    memory via `malloc` from the Node.js process. These buffers may contain data left
    over from GC'd / freed heap memory from other parts of the Node.js process, and
    may lead to exploitable memory corruption if Buffer() types are not properly checked
    in PouchDB.\n> \n> -- [https://github.com](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/5531)"

  title: SQL Injection
  description: |
    [`pouchdb`][1] is PouchDB is a pocket-sized database. Affected versions
    of the package are vulnerable to SQL Injection due to not properly
    escaping the startkey/endkey in the allDocs() function. You can read
    more about `SQL Injection` on our [blog][2].

  title: Arbitrary Code Injection
  description: |
    [`pouchDB`][1] is an open-source JavaScript database inspired by `Apache
    CouchDB` that is designed to run well within the browser.

    Vulnerable versions of the package had the `evalView` function in
    `pouchdb-core` to execute the view function without a sandbox. The fix
    was introduced in version `6.0.5`, executing the view function in a
    sandbox and enforcing strict mode when running in Node.js.

    The vulnerability was reported by [micaksica][2].
