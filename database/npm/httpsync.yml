  title: Downloads Resources over HTTP
  description: "Affected versions of `httpsync` insecurely download an executable
    over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \r\n\r\nIn scenarios where an attacker has
    a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace
    the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system
    running `httpsync`."

    to MITM attacks. It may be possible to cause remote code execution (RCE) by swapping
    out the requested binary with an attacker controlled binary if the attacker is
    on the network or positioned in between the user and the remote server.\n> \n>

  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol
  description: |
    [`httpsync`][1] is a port of libcurl to node.js.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man in the Middle
    (MitM) attacks due to downloading resources over an insecure protocol.
    Without a secure connection, it is possible for an attacker to intercept
    this connection and alter the packages received. In serious cases, this
    may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host server.
