  title: HTML Injection
  description: Versions of `preact` 10.x on prerelease tags alpha and beta prior to
    10.0.0-beta.1 are vulnerable to HTML Injection. Due to insufficient input validation
    the package allows attackers to inject JavaScript objects as virtual-dom nodes,
    which may lead to Cross-Site Scripting. This requires user input parsed with `JSON.parse()`
    to be passed directly into JSX without sanitization.

  title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  description: |
    [preact][1] is a fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of
    Untrusted Data when inserting a JSON object. This vulnerability occurs
    when a JSON object is passed to a HTML document\'s `createElement`
    method without validation, allowing insertion of objects with the same
    attributes.
