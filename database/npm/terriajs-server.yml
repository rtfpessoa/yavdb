  title: Server-Side Request Forgery
  description: Versions of `terriajs-server`prior to 2.7.4 are vulnerable to Server-Side
    Request Forgery (SSRF). If an attacker has access to a server whitelisted by the
    terriajs-server proxy or if the attacker is able to modify the DNS records of
    a domain whitelisted by the terriajs-server proxy, the attacker can use the terriajs-server
    proxy to access any HTTP-accessible resources that are accessible to the server,
    including private resources in the hosting environment.

  title: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  description: |
    [terriajs-server][1] is a basic NodeJS Express server that serves up a
    (not included) static TerriaJS-based site (such as National Map) with a
    few additional useful services.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-Side Request
    Forgery (SSRF). Once an attacker has access to a server whitelisted by
    the terriajs-server proxy, or the attacker is able to modify the DNS
    records of a domain whitelisted by the terriajs-server proxy, the
    terriajs-server proxy can be used to access any HTTP resources
    accessible to the server, including private data in the hosting
    environment.
