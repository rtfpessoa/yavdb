  description: |
    [`botkit`][1] is Building blocks for Building Bots.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS) attacks. An attacker may send huge arrays of requests or
    impersonate FB/users, causing the server to take extremely long time to
    process these requests.
