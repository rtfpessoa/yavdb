  title: Exposure of internal HTTP resources
  description: |-
    In `highcharts-export-server` before version 2.1.0 there is a vulnerability that allows exposure of internal HTTP resources.

    ### Impact

    The vulnerability allows for reading and outputting files served by other services on the internal network in which the export server is hosted. If the export server is exposed to the internet, this potentially allows a malicious user to gain read access to internal web-resources.

    The impact is limited to internal services that serve content via. HTTP(S), and requires the attacker to know internal hostnames/IP addresses.

    The previous versions have been marked as deprecated on NPM.

    ### Workarounds

    There are no known workarounds to the issue - an upgrade to version 2.1.0 is required.
