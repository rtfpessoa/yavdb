  title: Sandbox Breakout / Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: "All versions of `localeval` are vulnerable to Sandbox Escape leading
    to Remote Code Execution. The package fails to restrict access to the main context
    through `constructor.constructor`. This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary
    code in the system.  Evaluating the payload \n```\nconstructor.constructor(\"return
    process.env\")()\n``` \n\nreturns the contents of `process.env`."
