  title: Arbitrary JavaScript Code Injection
  description: |
    Old versions of `bassmaster`, a Hapi server plugin used to process
    batches of requests, use the `eval` method as part of its processing and
    validation of user input.

    An attacker can therefore provide arbitrary javascript in this input,
    which will be executed by this `eval` function without limitation.

    This is a very severe remote JavaScript code execution, and depending on
    the node process permissions can turn into [Arbitrary Remote Code
    Execution][1] on the operating system level as well.
