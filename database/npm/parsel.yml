  title: Hardcoded Initialization Vector
  description: All versions of `parsel` have a default hardcoded initialization vector.
    In cases where the IV is not provided, the package defaults to a hardcoded IV
    which renders the cipher vulnerable to chosen plaintext attacks.

  title: Insecure Cryptography Algorithm
  description: All versions of `parsel` use an insecure cryptography algorithm. The
    package uses `aes-256-cbc` without integrity checks, which renders the ciphertext
    vulnerable to bit-flipping attacks.

  title: Insufficient Entropy
  description: All versions of `parsel` use an insecure key derivation function. The
    package runs keys of arbitrary lengths through one round of SHA256 hashing for
    key stretching. This allows for the use of keys of insufficient entropy with inappropriate
    key stretching.

  title: Insecure Encryption
  description: |
    [parsel][1] is a library that allows you to encrypt and decrypt data
    with a given key.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Encryption.
    In cases where an initialisation vector is not supplied to the encrypt
    or decrypt call in `parsel.rb`, the initialisation vector used by the
    library is set to the hardcoded value in L10 of `config.rb`. This makes
    the cipher vulnerable to chosen plaintext attacks and data leakage
    within the first block.

  title: Bit-Flipping Attack
  description: |
    [parsel][1] is a library that allows you to encrypt and decrypt data
    with a given key.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Bit-Flipping Attack
    via the `ciphertext` function. `AES-256-CBC`, the construct used in
    `parsel.rb`, has no integrity check (i.e., there is no MAC for
    integrity.)

    ### Details   {#details}

    A bit-flipping attack is an attack on a cryptographic cipher in which
    the attacker can change the ciphertext in such a way as to result in a
    predictable change of the plaintext, although the attacker is not able
    to learn the plaintext itself.
