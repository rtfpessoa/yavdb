  title: Denial of Service
  description: |-
    Affected versions of `uws` do not properly handle large websocket messages when `permessage-deflate` is enabled, which may result in a denial of service condition.

    If `uws` recieves a 256Mb websocket message when `permessage-deflate` is enabled, the server will compress the message prior to executing the length check, and subsequently extract the message prior to processing. This can result in a situation where an excessively large websocket message passes the length checks, yet still gets cast from a Buffer to a string, which will exceed v8's maximum string size and crash the process.

  description: |+
    [`uws`][1] is Highly scalable WebSocket server &amp; client library.
    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Denial of Service.

    It is possible to crash the node process by sending a 256mb websocket
    message and exceeding V8\'s maximum string size.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
