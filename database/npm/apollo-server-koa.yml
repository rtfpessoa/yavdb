  title: Information Exposure
  description: Versions of `apollo-server-koa` prior to 2.4.12 are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The package does not properly enforce validation rules when creating
    subscription servers, which includes a `NoInstrospection` rule for the Websocket.
    This leaks the GraphQL schema types, their relations and human-readable names.   More
    information can be found on the references.
