  title: Elliptic Curve Key Disclosure
  description: |
    [`node-jose`][1] is A JavaScript implementation of the JSON Object
    Signing and Encryption (JOSE) for current web browsers and node.js-based
    servers.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Elliptic Curve Key
    Disclosure.

    A JSON Web Token (JWT) defines a container that transports data between
    two parties. When a JWT is signed with a private key by one of the
    parties, it\'s known as a JSON Web Signature (JWS).

    The \"JWK\" (JSON Web Key) is a JSON based open standard used for
    creating access tokens. JWK\'s `Header Parameter` allows it to include
    the public key that corresponds to the key used to sign the JWS. If the
    Header Parameter includes this public key, an attacker could then use it
    to generate a private key / public key pair, send the public key
    together with the signature and the signature will be valid.

    This vulnerability is related to [SNYK-JAVA-ORGBITBUCKETBC-30206][2] and
    [SNYK-JAVA-COMNIMBUSDS-30205][3]

  title: Insecure Token Validation
  description: |
    [`node-jose`][1] is a JavaScript implementation of the JSON Object
    Signing and Encryption (JOSE) for current web browsers and node.js-based
    servers.

    A vulnerability in the Cisco node-jose open source library before 0.11.0
    could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to re-sign tokens using
    a key that is embedded within the token. The vulnerability is due to
    node-jose following the JSON Web Signature (JWS) standard for JSON Web
    Tokens (JWTs). This standard specifies that a JSON Web Key (JWK)
    representing a public key can be embedded within the header of a JWS.
    This public key is then trusted for verification. An attacker could
    exploit this by forging valid JWS objects by removing the original
    signature, adding a new public key to the header, and then signing the
    object using the (attacker-owned) private key associated with the public
    key embedded in that JWS header.
