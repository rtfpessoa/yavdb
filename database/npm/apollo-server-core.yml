  title: Information Exposure
  description: Versions of `apollo-server-core` prior to 2.4.12 are vulnerable to
    Information Exposure. The package does not properly enforce validation rules when
    creating subscription servers, which includes a `NoInstrospection` rule for the
    Websocket. This leaks the GraphQL schema types, their relations and human-readable
    names.   More information can be found on the references.
