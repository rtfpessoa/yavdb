  title: Internal Property Tampering
  description: |
    [bson][1] is a BSON Parser for node and browser.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Internal Property
    Tampering. The package will ignore an unknown value for an object\'s
    `_bsotype`, leading to cases where an object is serialized as a document
    rather than the intended BSON type.
