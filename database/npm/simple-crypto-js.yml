  title: Insecure Cryptography Algorithm
  description: |
    [simple-crypto-js][1] is a JavaScript library that simplify the process
    of encryption and decryption of JavaScript objects.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure
    Cryptography Algorithm. Uses `AES-CBC` with `PKCS#7` padding, which is
    vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. This may allow attackers to break
    the encryption and access sensitive data.
