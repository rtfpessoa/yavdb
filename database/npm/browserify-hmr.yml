  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [browserify-hmr][1] is an implementation of Webpack\'s Hot Module
    Replacement API as a plugin for Browserify.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. The origin of requests was not checked by the `WebSocket`
    server, which is used for HMR (Hot Module Replacement). Anyone could
    receive the `HMR` message sent by the `WebSocket` server via a
    `ws://127.0.0.1:3123/` connection from any origin.
