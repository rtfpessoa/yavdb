  title: Sensitive Data Exposure
  description: Versions of `sequelize-cli` prior to 5.5.0 are vulnerable to Sensitive
    Data Exposure. The function `filteredURL()` does not properly sanitize the `config.password`
    value which may cause passwords with special characters to be logged in plain
    text.

  title: Sensitive Data Exposure
  description: |
    [sequelize-cli][1] is a Command Line Interface (CLI) package version of
    the Sequelize Object Relational Mapping (ORM) platform.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Sensitive Data
    Exposure. The `filteredUrl` function in sequelize-cli does not escape
    the `config.password` value, which allows sensitive user information
    such as passwords to be stored in log files.
