  title: Command Injection
  description: All versions of `priest-runner` are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The package fails to sanitize input and passes it directly to a `spawn` call,
    which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system. The `PriestController.prototype.createChild
    ` function is vulnerable since the `spawn` parameters come from a POST request
    body.
