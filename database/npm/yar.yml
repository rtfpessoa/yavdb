  title: Denial of Service
  description: |-
    Versions of `yar` prior to 2.2.0 are affected by a denial of service vulnerability related to an invalid encrypted session cookie value.

    When an invalid encryped session cookie value is provided, the process will crash.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    Yar uses an encrypted cookie for session support, during the hapi
    request/reply flow if this cookie value is invalid (changed by the
    end-user), a request object variable is not set. In versions prior
    2.2.0, the presence of this variable was not validated prior to use,
    resulting in an unhandled ReferenceError, which in most cases will crash
    the process.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
