  title: Malicious Package
  description: |
    [colour-string][1] is not currently in use, but was formerly occupied by
    another package. To avoid malicious use, npm is hanging on to the
    package name, but loosely, and we\'ll probably give it to you if you
    want it.

    This package is malicious. It contains malicious code as a preinstall
    script. The package downloads a file from a remote server, executes it
    and opens a backdoor.
