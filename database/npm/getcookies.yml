    `getcookies` contains a malicious backdoor.

    The backdoor works by parsing the user-supplied HTTP `request.headers`,
    looking for specifically formatted data that provides three different
    commands to the backdoor:

    * resetting the code buffer.
    * executing code located in the buffer by calling `vm.runInThisContext`,
      providing `module.exports`, `required`, `req`, `res`, and `next` as
      arguments.
    * loading remote code in to memory for execution.

    These control codes allowed for an attacker to input arbitrary code into
    a running server and execute it.

    The list of packages and their scripts are:

        express-cookies
        getcookies
        http-fetch-cookies
