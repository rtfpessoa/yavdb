  title: Sensitive data exposure in NATS
  description: |-
    Preview versions of two NPM packages and one Deno package from the NATS
    project contain an information disclosure flaw, leaking options to the
    NATS server; for one package, this includes TLS private credentials.

    The connection configuration options in these JavaScript-based
    implementations were fully serialized and sent to the server in the
    client's CONNECT message, immediately after TLS establishment.

    The nats.js client supports Mutual TLS and the credentials for the TLS
    client key are included in the connection configuration options;
    disclosure of the client's TLS private key to the server has been
    observed.

    Most authentication mechanisms are handled after connection, instead of
    as part of connection, so other authentication mechanisms are
    unaffected.
    For clarity: NATS account NKey authentication is NOT affected.

    Neither the nats.ws nor the nats.deno clients support Mutual TLS: the
    affected versions listed below are those where the logic flaw is
    present. We are including the nats.ws and nats.deno versions out of an
    abundance of caution, as library maintainers, but rate as minimal the
    likelihood of applications leaking sensitive data.

    Affected versions:

    Security impact:

    NPM package nats.js:
    mainline is unaffected
    beta branch is vulnerable from 2.0.0-201, fixed in 2.0.0-209
    Logic flaw:

    NPM package nats.ws:
    status: preview
    flawed from 1.0.0-85, fixed in 1.0.0-111
    Deno repository https://github.com/nats-io/nats.deno
    status: preview
    flawed in all git tags prior to fix
    fixed with git tag v1.0.0-9
    Impact:

    For deployments using TLS client certificates (for mutual TLS), private
    key material for TLS is leaked from the client application to the
    server. If the server is untrusted (run by a third party), or if the
    client application also disables TLS verification (and so the true
    identity of the server is unverifiable) then authentication credentials
    are leaked.
