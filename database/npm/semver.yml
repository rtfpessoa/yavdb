  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
  description: "[npm][1] is a package manager for javascript.\n\nAffected versions
    of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression\nDenial of Service (ReDoS).
    The semver module uses regular expressions\nwhen parsing a version string. For
    a carefully crafted input, the time\nit takes to process these regular expressions
    is not linear to the\nlength of the input. Since the semver module did not enforce
    a limit on\nthe version string length, an attacker could provide a long string
    that\nwould take up a large amount of resources, potentially taking a server\ndown.
    This issue therefore enables a potential Denial of Service attack.\nThis is a
    slightly differnt variant of a typical Regular Expression\nDenial of Service ([ReDoS][2])
    vulnerability.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://github.com/npm/npm\n[2]: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS\n\\nDenial
    of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at\nmaking a system
    inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There\nare many types of DoS
    attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network\npipes to the system by generating
    a large volume of traffic from many\nmachines (a Distributed Denial of Service
    - DDoS - attack) to sending\ncrafted requests that cause a system to crash or
    take a disproportional\namount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial
    of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of\nService attack. Regular expressions
    are incredibly powerful, but they\naren\\'t very intuitive and can ultimately
    end up making it easy for\nattackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the
    following regular expression as an example:\n\n    regex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n\nThis
    regular expression accomplishes the following:\n\n* `A` The string must start
    with the letter \\'A\\'\n* `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A
    with either the\n  letter \\'B\\' or some number of occurrences of the letter
    \\'C\\' (the\n  `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section\n
    \ states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n* `D` Finally,
    we ensure this section of the string ends with a \\'D\\'\n\nThe expression would
    match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD`\nand `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases,
    it doesn\\'t take very long for a regex engine to find a\nmatch:\n\n    $ time
    node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n    0.04s user
    0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n    \n    $ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n
    \   1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n\nThe entire process of testing
    it against a 30 characters long string\ntakes around ~52ms. But when given an
    invalid string, it takes nearly\ntwo seconds to complete the test, over ten times
    as long as it took to\ntest a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to
    the way regular\nexpressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very
    similarly (with minor differences).\nThe engine will match the first possible
    way to accept the current\ncharacter and proceed to the next one. If it then fails
    to match the\nnext one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to
    digest\nthe previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to\nfind
    out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters\nhave multiple
    valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can\nbecome very large, resulting
    in what is known as *catastrophic\nbacktracking*.\n\nLet\\'s look at how our expression
    runs into this problem, using a\nshorter string: \\\"ACCCX\\\". While it seems
    fairly straightforward, there\nare still four different ways that the engine could
    match those three\nC\\'s:\n\n1.  CCC\n2.  CC+C\n3.  C+CC\n4.  C+C+C.\n\nThe engine
    has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them\npotentially match
    against the expression. When you combine that with the\nother steps the engine
    must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger][1] to\nsee the engine has to take a
    total of 38 steps before it can determine\nthe string doesn\\'t match.\n\nFrom
    there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string\njust continues
    to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C\\'s | Number of steps |\n|----------\n| ACCCX
    | 3 | 38 |\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71 |\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136 |\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14
    | 65,553 |\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C\\'s, the engine has to take
    over\n65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme\nsituations
    can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to\ninput size, as shown
    above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and\ncan cause the service to excessively
    consume CPU, resulting in a Denial\nof Service.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://regex101.com/debugger\n"
