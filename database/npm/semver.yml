  description: |+
    [semver][1] is a semantic version parser used by npm.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression
    Denial of Service (ReDoS).

    \n[npm][1] is a package manager for javascript.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression
    Denial of Service (ReDoS). The semver module uses regular expressions
    when parsing a version string. For a carefully crafted input, the time
    it takes to process these regular expressions is not linear to the
    length of the input. Since the semver module did not enforce a limit on
    the version string length, an attacker could provide a long string that
    would take up a large amount of resources, potentially taking a server
    down. This issue therefore enables a potential Denial of Service attack.
    This is a slightly differnt variant of a typical Regular Expression
    Denial of Service ([ReDoS][2]) vulnerability.
