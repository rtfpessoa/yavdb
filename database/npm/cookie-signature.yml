  title: Timing Attack
  description: "Affected versions of `cookie-signature` are vulnerable to timing attacks
    as a result of using a fail-early comparison instead of a constant-time comparison.
    \n\nTiming attacks remove the exponential increase in entropy gained from increased
    secret length, by providing per-character feedback on the correctness of a guess
    via miniscule timing differences.\n\nUnder favorable network conditions, an attacker
    can exploit this to guess the secret in no more than `charset*length` guesses,
    instead of `charset^length` guesses required were the timing attack not present.

  title: Non-Constant Time String Comparison
  description: |
    [\'cookie-signature\'][1] is a library for signing cookies.

    Versions before `1.0.4` of the library use the built-in string
    comparison mechanism, `===`, and not a time constant string comparison.
    As a result, the comparison will fail faster when the first characters
    in the token are incorrect. An attacker can use this difference to
    perform a timing attack, essentially allowing them to guess the secret
    one character at a time.
