  title: Remote Code Execution
  description: |-
    MIT Lifelong Kindergarten Scratch scratch-vm before 0.2.0-prerelease.20200714185213 loads extension URLs from untrusted project.json files with certain _ characters, resulting in remote code execution because the URL's content is treated as a script and is executed as a worker. The responsible code is getExtensionIdForOpcode in serialization/sb3.js. The use of _ is incompatible with a protection mechanism in older versions, in which URLs were split and consequently deserialization attacks were prevented.
    NOTE: the scratch.mit.edu hosted service is not affected because of the lack of worker scripts.

  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: |
    [scratch-vm][1] is a Virtual Machine for Scratch 3.0

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation. When loading an SB3, it is determined whether a block is
    part of an extension by inspecting its \"extended\" opcode (for example,
    `pen_clear` requires the `pen` extension). The extension ID is not
    sanitised, and some characters may cause potential problems.
