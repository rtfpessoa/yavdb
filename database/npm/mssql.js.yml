  title: Malicious Package
  description: |
    `mssql.js` is a one of 37 malicious packages that use [typosquatting][1]
    to bait unknowing users to install them. These packages, which carry
    similar names to an original package, offer all the functionality of
    their original, but also include a code snippet that sends all your
    environment variables to a remote server controlled by malicious
    operators when your code is running.

    This is especially dangerous in production runtime environments, where
    environment variables tend to consist of keys, passwords, tokens and
    other secrets.

    On August 1st, 2017 npm deprecated all malicious typosquatting libraries
    from this list.
