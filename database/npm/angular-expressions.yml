  title: Remote Code Execution
  description: "Affected versions of `angular-expressions` are affected by a remote
    code execution vulnerability.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf you call `expressions.compile(userControlledInput)`
    where `userControlledInput` is text that comes from user input you are potentially
    impacted.\n\nThe security of the package could be bypassed by using a more complex
    payload, using a `.constructor.constructor` technique.\n\n* If running `angular-expressions`
    in the browser, an attacker could run any browser script when the application
    code calls `expressions.compile(userControlledInput)`.\n* If running `angular-expressions`
    on the server, an attacker could run any Javascript expression, thus gaining Remote
    Code Execution.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nA temporary workaround might be either to
    : \n\n* disable user-controlled input that will be fed into `angular-expressions`
    in your application\n\nOR\n\n* allow only following characters in the userControlledInput
    : \n\n```js\nif (/^[|a-zA-Z.0-9 :\"'+-?]+$/.test(userControlledInput)) {\n      var
    result = expressions.compile(userControlledInput);\n}\nelse {\n     result = undefined;\n}\n```\n"

  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [angular-expressions][1] is an Angular expression as standalone module.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE) when `expressions.compile`(userControlledInput) is
    called where `userControlledInput` is text that comes from user input.
    If running angular-expressions in the browser, an attacker could run any
    browser script when the application code calls
    `expressions.compile`(userControlledInput). If running
    angular-expressions on the server, an attacker could run any Javascript
    expression, thus gaining Remote Code Execution.
