  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol
  description: |
    [`iedriver`][1] is an NPM wrapper for Selenium IEDriver.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man in the Middle
    (MitM) attacks due to downloading resources over an insecure protocol.
    Without a secure connection, it is possible for an attacker to intercept
    this connection and alter the packages received. In serious cases, this
    may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host server.
