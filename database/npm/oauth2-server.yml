  title: Code Injection
  description: '`oauth2-server` (aka node-oauth2-server) through 3.1.1 implements
    OAuth 2.0 without PKCE. It does not prevent authorization code injection. This
    is similar to CVE-2020-7692. NOTE: the vendor states ''As RFC7636 is an extension,
    I think the claim in the Readme of "RFC 6749 compliant" is valid and not misleading
    and I also therefore wouldn''t describe this as a "vulnerability" with the library
    per se.''"'
