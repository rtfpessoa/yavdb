  description: Version of `kerberos` prior to 1.0.0 are vulnerable to DLL Injection.
    The package loads DLLs without specifying a full path. This may allow attackers
    to create a file with the same name in a folder that precedes the intended file
    in the DLL path search. Doing so would allow attackers to execute arbitrary code
    in the machine.
