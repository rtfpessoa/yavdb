  title: Memory Exposure
  description: |-
    Versions of `bl` before 0.9.5 and 1.0.1 are vulnerable to memory exposure.

    `bl.append(number)` in the affected `bl` versions passes a number to Buffer constructor, appending a chunk of uninitialized memory

  title: Uninitialized Memory Exposure
  description: "[bl][1] is a storage object for collections of Node Buffers.\n\nA
    possible memory disclosure vulnerability exists when a value of type\n`number`
    is provided to the `append()` method and results in\nconcatenation of uninitialized
    memory to the buffer collection.\n\nThis is a result of unobstructed use of the
    `Buffer` constructor, whose\ninsecure default constructor increases the odds of
    memory leakage.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/bl\n\\nConstructing
    a `Buffer` class with integer `N` creates a `Buffer` of\nlength `N` with raw (not
    \\\"zero-ed\\\") memory.\n\nIn the following example, the first call would allocate
    100 bytes of\nmemory, while the second example will allocate the memory needed
    for the\nstring \\\"100\\\":\n\n    // uninitialized Buffer of length 100\n    x
    = new Buffer(100);\n    // initialized Buffer with value of '100'\n    x = new
    Buffer('100');\n{: .language-js}\n\n`bl`\\'s `append` function uses the default
    `Buffer` constructor as-is,\nmaking it easy to append uninitialized memory to
    an existing list. If\nthe value of the buffer list is exposed to users, it may
    expose raw\nserver side memory, potentially holding secrets, private data and
    code.\nThis is a similar vulnerability to the infamous [`Heartbleed`][1] flaw\nin
    OpenSSL.\n\n    const BufferList = require('bl')\n    \n    var bl = new BufferList()\n
    \   bl.append(new Buffer('abcd'))\n    bl.append(new Buffer('efg'))\n    bl.append('100')\n
    \   // appends a Buffer holding 100 bytes of uninitialized memory\n    bl.append(100)
    \                    \n    bl.append(new Buffer('j'))\n{: .language-js}\n\nYou
    can read more about the insecure `Buffer` behavior [on our blog][2].\n\nSimilar
    vulnerabilities were discovered in [request][3], [mongoose][4],\n[ws][5] and [sequelize][6].\n\n**Note**
    This is vulnerable only for Node &lt;=4\n\n\n\n[1]: http://heartbleed.com/\n[2]:

  title: Remote Memory Exposure
  description: |
    [bl][1] is a library that allows you to collect buffers and access with
    a standard readable buffer interface.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Memory
    Exposure. If user input ends up in `consume()` argument and can become
    negative, BufferList state can be corrupted, tricking it into exposing
    uninitialized memory via regular `.slice()` calls.

    ### PoC by chalker   {#poc-by-chalker}

        const { BufferList } = require('bl')
        const secret = require('crypto').randomBytes(256)
        for (let i = 0; i < 1e6; i++) {
          const clone = Buffer.from(secret)
          const bl = new BufferList()
          bl.append(Buffer.from('a'))
          bl.consume(-1024)
          const buf = bl.slice(1)
          if (buf.indexOf(clone) !== -1) {
            console.error(`Match (at ${i})`, buf)
          }
        }
