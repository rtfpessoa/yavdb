  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |
    bleach 3.0 and earlier is vulnerable to [Regular expression Denial of
    Service (ReDoS)][1] when certain types of input are passed into the
    sanitize function.

    `bleach` performs html sanitization, which has definite value from a
    security perspective. However, it does not control the length of the
    html it processes, and uses regular expressions to parse it. As a
    result, it is susceptible to a [Regular expression Denial of Service
    (ReDoS)][1] vulnerabilities, rendering an application unavailable if a
    long or complex input is passed in.
