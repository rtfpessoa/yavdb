  title: Reverse Tabnabbing
  description: Versions of `quill` prior to 1.3.7 are vulnerable to [Reverse Tabnabbing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Reverse_Tabnabbing).
    The package uses `target='_blank'` in anchor tags, allowing attackers to access
    `window.opener` for the original page when opening links. This is commonly used
    for phishing attacks.

  title: Reverse Tabnabbing
  description: |
    [quill][1] is a modern rich text editor built for compatibility and
    extensibility.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Reverse Tabnabbing
    via the snow theme. The link has the target attribute set to `_blank`
    but has no `rel` property. This means that documents containing
    untrusted links make the page they are embedded in susceptible to
    tabnabbing.
