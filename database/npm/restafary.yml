  title: Directory Traversal
  description: |-
    Affected versions of `restafary` are susceptible to a directory traversal vulnerability when a root path is specified in the configuration.


    Proof of Concept

    ```
    curl -i -s -k  -X 'GET' -H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=' 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/fs/..%2f..%2fetc/passwd'
    ```

  vulnerable_versions:
  - "<1.6.1"
  severity: medium

  - CVE-2016-10528
  cwe: CWE-22

  title: Directory Traversal
  description: |
    `restafary` versions prior to 1.6.1 did not properly prevent path
    traversal, allowing access to sensitive files and data on the server.
    For example, requesting the following url
    `/api/v1/fs/..%2f..%2fetc/passwd` would result in `/etc/passwd` leak.

    \nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to
    access files and directories that are stored outside the intended
    folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and
    its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to
    access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including
    application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.

    Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two
    types:

    * **Information Disclosure**\: Allows the attacker to gain information
      about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on
      the system.

    `st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a
    [vulnerability of this type][1]. In our example, we will serve files
    from the `public` route.

    If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in
    turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.

        curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa

    **Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).

    * **Writing arbitrary files**\: Allows the attacker to create or replace
      existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as
      `Zip-Slip`.

    One way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds
    path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets
    concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the
    final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a
    configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code,
    the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite
    easily.

    The following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and
    one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in
    traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/`
    overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

        2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
        2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys
