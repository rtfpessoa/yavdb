  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [front-matter][1] is a package that extracts meta data (front-matter)
    from documents.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution due to the default usage of the function `yaml.load()` of the
    package [js-yaml][2] instead of its secure replacement ,
    `yaml.safeLoad()`.
