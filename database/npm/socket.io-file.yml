  title: Path Traversal
  description: All versions of `socket.io-file` are vulnerable to Path Traversal.
    The package fails to sanitize user input and uses it to generate the file upload
    paths. The `socket.io-file::createFile` message contains a `name` option that
    is passed directly to `path.join()`.   It is possible to upload files to arbitrary
    folders on the server by sending relative paths on the `name` value, such as `../../test.js`.  The
    `uploadDir` and `rename` options can be used to define the file upload path.
