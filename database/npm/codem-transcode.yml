  title: Arbitrary Command Injection
  description: |+
    The `codem-transcode` package supports a feature (off by default) to
    interact with a local `ffprobe`. When enabled, POST requests to `/probe`
    trigger the execution of the local `ffprobe` binary, with the provided
    parameters.

    This execution is done using `exec`, allowing piped requests, and
    therefore enabling remote command execution. Newer versions use
    `execFile` instead, preventing such injection (though still giving
    attackers to whatever functionality `ffprobe` supports, and any
    weaknesses in it).

    Note that, by default, the package only listens for such requests from
    the local network interface, greatly reducing the likelihood of
    exploitation.
