  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [elliptic][1] is a Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a plain
    javascript implementation.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attack.
    Practical recovery of the long-term private key generated by the library
    is possible under certain conditions. Leakage of a bit-length of the
    scalar during scalar multiplication is possible on an elliptic curve
    which might allow practical recovery of the long-term private key.
