  title: Signature Malleability
  description: The Elliptic package before version 6.5.3 for Node.js allows ECDSA
    signature malleability via variations in encoding, leading '\0' bytes, or integer
    overflows. This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact if an application
    relied on a single canonical signature.

  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [elliptic][1] is a Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a plain
    javascript implementation.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attack.
    Practical recovery of the long-term private key generated by the library
    is possible under certain conditions. Leakage of bit-length of a scalar
    during scalar multiplication is possible on an elliptic curve which
    might allow practical recovery of the long-term private key.
