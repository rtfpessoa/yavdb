  title: Command Injection
  description: Versions of `pullit` prior to 1.4.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The package does not validate input on git branch names  and concatenates it to
    an exec call, allowing attackers to run arbitrary commands in the system.

  title: Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |
    [`pullit`][1] is Display and pull branches from GitHub pull requests.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. due to an insecure use of the `eval()` function. Node.js
    provides the `eval()` function by default, and is used to translate
    strings into Javascript code. An attacker can craft a malicious payload
    to inject arbitrary commands. `pullit` uses this function in order to
    call git commands, which originate from user input in terms of a
    carefully created remote branch name on GitHub, which pullit pulls
    branch names from.
