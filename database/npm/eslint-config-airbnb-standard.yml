  description: |
    [`eslint-config-airbnb-standard`][1] extends ESLint with airbnb and
    standard configs.

    Versions 2.0.0, 2.1.0 and 2.1.1 were identified as malicious after a
    possible npm account takeover. During installation, the malicious code
    download code from `pastebin.com`, then executed it. It sent the
    contents of the userâ€™s `.npmrc` file to the attacker, which typically
    contains access tokens for publishing to npm.

    The malicious package versions have been unpublished from npm.
