  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [git-promise][1] is a Simple wrapper that allows you to run any git
    command using a more intuitive syntax.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). The issue occurs because a `user input` is formatted
    inside a `command` that will be executed without any check.
