  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [@fraction/oasis][1] is a peer-to-peer social application that helps you
    follow friends and discover new ones on Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB).

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). If you\'re running a vulnerable application on your
    computer and an attacker can trick you into visiting a malicious
    website, they could use DNS rebinding and CSRF attacks to read/write to
    vulnerable applications.
