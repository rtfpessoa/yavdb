  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [node-prompt-here][1] is a package to open a console window at given
    absolute directory.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The `runCommand()` is called by `getDevices()` function in file
    `linux/manager.js`, which is required by the `index. process.env.NM_CLI`
    in the file \"linux/manager.js\" . This function is used to construct
    the argument of function `execSync()`, which can be controlled by users
    without any sanitization.

    ### PoC   {#poc}

        process.env.NM_CLI = 'echo vulnerable > create.txt & nmcli';
        var root = require("network-manager");
        root.getDevices();
