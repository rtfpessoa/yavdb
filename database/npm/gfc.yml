  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [gfc][1] is a Simple way to initialize a new git repository in an empty
    directory, add a file and do a first commit (or skip that part in a
    directory with files). Useful for unit tests and generators.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection
    via the `options` argument which is used to build the command that is
    passed to the `child_process.exec` function without any sanitization.

    ### POC   {#poc}

        const firstCommit = require('gfc');
        const options = {message: '""; touch HACKED;'};
        firstCommit('.', options, function(err) {});
