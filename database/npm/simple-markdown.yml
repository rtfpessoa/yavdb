    cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a\nlegitimate web-based
    application or site to accept a request as\noriginating from a trusted source.\n\nThis
    is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web\napplication then
    delivers that data to its users along with other\ntrusted dynamic content, without
    validating it. The browser unknowingly\nexecutes malicious script on the client
    side (through client-side\nlanguages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to
    perform actions that\nare otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin
    Policy.\n\nֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS
    is\nexploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this\nmanipulation
    is the top method for securing code against this\nvulnerability.\n\nEscaping means
    that the application is coded to mark key characters, and\nparticularly key characters
    included in user input, to prevent those\ncharacters from being interpreted in
    a dangerous context. For example,\nin HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>`
    can be coded as `&gt`; in\norder to be interpreted and displayed as themselves
    in text, while\nwithin the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious\ncontent
    is injected into an application that escapes special characters\nand that malicious
    content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those\ncharacters are nonetheless not interpreted
    as HTML tags by the browser\nif they’ve been correctly escaped in the application
    code and in this\nway the attempted attack is diverted.\n\nThe most prominent
    use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP\nHttpOnly) and hijack user sessions,
    but XSS exploits have been used to\nexpose sensitive information, enable access
    to privileged services and\nfunctionality and deliver malware.\n\n### Types of
    attacks   {#types-of-attacks}\n\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|
    Type | Origin | Description |\n|----------\n| **Stored** | Server | The malicious
    code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code
    is activated every time a user clicks the link. |\n| **Reflected** | Server |
    The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site
    application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable
    web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. |\n| **DOM-based**
    | Client | The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page.
    The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data. |\n| **Mutated**
    |  | The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified
    by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation
    marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters. |\n\n### Affected
    environments   {#affected-environments}\n\nThe following environments are susceptible
    to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n###
    How to prevent   {#how-to-prevent}\n\nThis section describes the top best practices
    designed to specifically\nprotect your code:\n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP
    request before reflecting it back,\n  ensuring all data is validated, filtered
    or escaped before echoing\n  anything back to the user, such as the values of
    query parameters\n  during searches.\n* Convert special characters such as `?`,
    `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces\n  to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.\n*
    Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n*
    Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP\n  addresses,
    and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source:
    Wikipedia) to\n  disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n*
    Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your\n  code to
    understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n"

  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
  description: "[simple-markdown][1] is a markdown-like parser designed for simplicity\nand
    extensibility.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular
    Expression\nDenial of Service (ReDoS) via inline code blocks.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-markdown\n\\nDenial
    of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at\nmaking a system
    inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There\nare many types of DoS
    attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network\npipes to the system by generating
    a large volume of traffic from many\nmachines (a Distributed Denial of Service
    - DDoS - attack) to sending\ncrafted requests that cause a system to crash or
    take a disproportional\namount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial
    of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of\nService attack. Regular expressions
    are incredibly powerful, but they\naren\\'t very intuitive and can ultimately
    end up making it easy for\nattackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the
    following regular expression as an example:\n\n    regex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n{: .language-js}\n\nThis
    regular expression accomplishes the following:\n\n* `A` The string must start
    with the letter \\'A\\'\n* `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A
    with either the\n  letter \\'B\\' or some number of occurrences of the letter
    \\'C\\' (the\n  `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section\n
    \ states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n* `D` Finally,
    we ensure this section of the string ends with a \\'D\\'\n\nThe expression would
    match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD`\nand `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases,
    it doesn\\'t take very long for a regex engine to find a\nmatch:\n\n    $ time
    node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n    0.04s user
    0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n    \n    $ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n
    \   1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n{: .language-bash}\n\nThe entire
    process of testing it against a 30 characters long string\ntakes around ~52ms.
    But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly\ntwo seconds to complete the
    test, over ten times as long as it took to\ntest a valid string. The dramatic
    difference is due to the way regular\nexpressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex
    engines will work very similarly (with minor differences).\nThe engine will match
    the first possible way to accept the current\ncharacter and proceed to the next
    one. If it then fails to match the\nnext one, it will backtrack and see if there
    was another way to digest\nthe previous character. If it goes too far down the
    rabbit hole only to\nfind out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many
    characters\nhave multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps
    can\nbecome very large, resulting in what is known as *catastrophic\nbacktracking*.\n\nLet\\'s
    look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a\nshorter string: \\\"ACCCX\\\".
    While it seems fairly straightforward, there\nare still four different ways that
    the engine could match those three\nC\\'s:\n\n1.  CCC\n2.  CC+C\n3.  C+CC\n4.
    \ C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of
    them\npotentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the\nother
    steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger][1] to\nsee the engine
    has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine\nthe string doesn\\'t
    match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string\njust
    continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C\\'s | Number of steps |\n|----------\n|
    ACCCX | 3 | 38 |\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71 |\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136 |\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX
    | 14 | 65,553 |\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C\\'s, the engine has to
    take over\n65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme\nsituations
    can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to\ninput size, as shown
    above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and\ncan cause the service to excessively
    consume CPU, resulting in a Denial\nof Service.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://regex101.com/debugger\n"
