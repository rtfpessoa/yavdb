  title: Improper minification of non-boolean comparisons
  description: "[`uglify-js`][1] is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor and\nbeautifier
    toolkit.\n\n[Tom MacWright][2] discovered that UglifyJS versions 2.4.23 and earlier\nare
    affected by a vulnerability which allows a specially crafted\nJavascript file
    to have altered functionality after minification. This\nbug was [demonstrated][3]
    by [Yan][4] to allow potentially malicious\ncode to be hidden within secure code,
    activated by minification.\n\n### Details   {#details}\n\nIn Boolean algebra,
    DeMorgan\\'s laws describe the relationships between\nconjunctions (`&&`), disjunctions
    (`||`) and negations (`!`). In\nJavascript form, they state that:\n\n     !(a
    && b) === (!a) || (!b)\n     !(a || b) === (!a) && (!b)\n\nThe law does not hold
    true when one of the values is not a boolean\nhowever.\n\nVulnerable versions
    of UglifyJS do not account for this restriction, and\nerroneously apply the laws
    to a statement if it can be reduced in length\nby it.\n\nConsider this authentication
    function:\n\n    function isTokenValid(user) {\n        var timeLeft =\n            !!config
    && // config object exists\n            !!user.token && // user object has a token\n
    \           !user.token.invalidated && // token is not explicitly invalidated\n
    \           !config.uninitialized && // config is initialized\n            !config.ignoreTimestamps
    && // don't ignore timestamps\n            getTimeLeft(user.token.expiry); //
    > 0 if expiration is in the future\n    \n        // The token must not be expired\n
    \       return timeLeft > 0;\n    }\n    \n    function getTimeLeft(expiry) {\n
    \     return expiry - getSystemTime();\n    }\n\nWhen minified with a vulnerable
    version of UglifyJS, it will produce the\nfollowing insecure output, where a token
    will never expire:\n\n( Formatted for readability )\n\n    function isTokenValid(user)
    {\n        var timeLeft = !(                       // negation\n            !config
    \                            // config object does not exist\n            || !user.token
    \                     // user object does not have a token\n            || user.token.invalidated
    \          // token is explicitly invalidated\n            || config.uninitialized
    \            // config isn't initialized\n            || config.ignoreTimestamps
    \         // ignore timestamps\n            || !getTimeLeft(user.token.expiry)
    \ // > 0 if expiration is in the future\n        );\n        return timeLeft >
    0\n    }\n    \n    function getTimeLeft(expiry) {\n        return expiry - getSystemTime()\n

  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: "The `parse()` function in the [`uglify-js`][1] package prior to version\n2.6.0
    is vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS)\nattacks when long
    inputs of certain patterns are processed.\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes
    a family of attacks, all aimed at\nmaking a system inaccessible to its original
    and legitimate users. There\nare many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying
    to clog the network\npipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic
    from many\nmachines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending\ncrafted
    requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional\namount of time
    to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial
    of\nService attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they\naren\\'t
    very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for\nattackers to take
    your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n\n
    \   regex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n\n*
    `A` The string must start with the letter \\'A\\'\n* `(B|C+)+` The string must
    then follow the letter A with either the\n  letter \\'B\\' or some number of occurrences
    of the letter \\'C\\' (the\n  `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end
    of this section\n  states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n*
    `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a \\'D\\'\n\nThe expression
    would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD`\nand `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt
    most cases, it doesn\\'t take very long for a regex engine to find a\nmatch:\n\n
    \   $ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n    0.04s
    user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n    \n    $ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n
    \   1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n\nThe entire process of testing
    it against a 30 characters long string\ntakes around ~52ms. But when given an
    invalid string, it takes nearly\ntwo seconds to complete the test, over ten times
    as long as it took to\ntest a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to
    the way regular\nexpressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very
    similarly (with minor differences).\nThe engine will match the first possible
    way to accept the current\ncharacter and proceed to the next one. If it then fails
    to match the\nnext one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to
    digest\nthe previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to\nfind
    out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters\nhave multiple
    valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can\nbecome very large, resulting
    in what is known as *catastrophic\nbacktracking*.\n\nLet\\'s look at how our expression
    runs into this problem, using a\nshorter string: \\\"ACCCX\\\". While it seems
    fairly straightforward, there\nare still four different ways that the engine could
    match those three\nC\\'s:\n\n1.  CCC\n2.  CC+C\n3.  C+CC\n4.  C+C+C.\n\nThe engine
    has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them\npotentially match
    against the expression. When you combine that with the\nother steps the engine
    must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger][2] to\nsee the engine has to take a
    total of 38 steps before it can determine\nthe string doesn\\'t match.\n\nFrom
    there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string\njust continues
    to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C\\'s | Number of steps |\n|----------\n| ACCCX
    | 3 | 38 |\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71 |\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136 |\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14
    | 65,553 |\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C\\'s, the engine has to take
    over\n65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme\nsituations
    can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to\ninput size, as shown
    above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and\ncan cause the service to excessively
    consume CPU, resulting in a Denial\nof Service.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js\n[2]:
