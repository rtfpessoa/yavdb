  title: Signature Validation Bypass
  description: |
    [xml-crypto][1] is a xml digital signature and encryption library for
    Node.js.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Signature Validation
    Bypass. An attacker can inject an `HMAC-SHA1` signature that is valid
    using only knowledge of the RSA public key. This allows bypassing
    signature validation.
