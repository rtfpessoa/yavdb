  title: Potential Command Injection
  description: "Affected versions of `shell-quote` do not properly escape command
    line arguments, which may result in command injection if the library is used to
    escape user input destined for use as command line arguments.\n\n\n\n## Proof
    of Concept:\n\nThe following characters are not escaped properly: `>`,`;`,`{`,`}`\n\nBash
    has a neat but not well known feature known as \"Bash Brace Expansion\", wherein
    a sub-command can be executed without spaces by running it between a set of `{}`
    and using the `,` instead of ` ` to seperate arguments. Because of this, full
    command injection is possible even though it was initially thought to be impossible.
    \n\n```\n   const quote = require('shell-quote').quote;\n   console.log(quote(['a;{echo,test,123,234}']));\n
    \  // Actual                    \"a;{echo,test,123,234}\"\n   // Expected                  \"a\\;\\{echo,test,123,234\\}\"\n
    \  // Functional Equivalent     \"a; echo 'test' '123' '1234'\"\n```\n"

  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [shell-quote][1] is a package used to quote and parse shell commands.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The `quote` function does not properly escape the following special
    characters `<`, `>`, `;`, `{`, `}` , and as a result can be used by an
    attacker to inject malicious shell commands or leak sensitive
    information.
