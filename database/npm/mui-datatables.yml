  title: CSV Injection
  description: |
    [mui-datatables][1] is a data tables component built on Material-UI.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to CSV Injection. CSV
    Injection, also known as Formula Injection, occurs when websites embed
    untrusted input inside CSV files. When a spreadsheet program is used to
    open a CSV, any cells starting with \'=\' will be interpreted by the
    software as a formula. Maliciously crafted formulas can be used for
    three key attacks:

    * Hijacking the user\'s computer by exploiting vulnerabilities in the
      spreadsheet software.
    * Hijacking the user\'s computer by exploiting the user\'s tendency to
      ignore security warnings in spreadsheets that they downloaded from
      their own website
    * Exfiltrating contents from the spreadsheet, or other open
      spreadsheets.
