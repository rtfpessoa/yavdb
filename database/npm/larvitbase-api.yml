  title: Unintended Require
  description: Versions of `larvitbase-api` prior to 0.5.4 are vulnerable to an Unintended
    Require. The package exposes an API endpoint and passes a GET parameter unsanitized
    to an `require()` call. This allows attackers to execute any `.js` file in the
    same folder as the server is running.

  title: Directory Traversal
  description: |
    [larvitbase-api][1] is a part of larbitbase - a scaled down version of
    Express.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal.
    The server dynamically loads some parts of the code. As long as the path
    to required module is partially depend on the URL, an attacker can cause
    code to load that was not intended to run on the server.
