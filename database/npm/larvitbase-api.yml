  title: Unintended Require
  description: Versions of `larvitbase-api` prior to 0.5.4 are vulnerable to an Unintended
    Require. The package exposes an API endpoint and passes a GET parameter unsanitized
    to an `require()` call. This allows attackers to execute any `.js` file in the
    same folder as the server is running.

  title: Relative Path Traversal
  description: |
    [larvitbase-api][1] is a part of larbitbase - a scaled down version of
    Express.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Relative Path
    Traversal. The server dynamically loads some parts of the code. As long
    as the path to required module is partially depend on the URL, an
    attacker can cause code to load that was not intended to run on the
    server.
