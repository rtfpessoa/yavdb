  title: Server-Side Request Forgery
  description: Versions of `ftp-srv` prior to 4.3.4 are vulnerable to Server-Side
    Request Forgery (SSRF). The package fails to prevent remote clients to access
    other resources in the network, for example when connecting to the server through
    telnet. This allows attackers to access any network resources available to the
    server, including private resources in the hosting environment.
