  title: Server-Side Request Forgery
  description: Versions of `ftp-srv` prior to versions 2.19.6, 3.1.2, and 4.3.4 are
    vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The package fails to prevent
    remote clients to access other resources in the network, for example when connecting
    to the server through telnet. This allows attackers to access any network resources
    available to the server, including private resources in the hosting environment.

    ### Impact

    Clients of FTP servers utilizing `ftp-srv` hosted on Windows machines can escape the  FTP user's defined root folder using the expected FTP commands, for example, `CWD` and `UPDR`.

    ### Background

    When windows separators exist within the path (`\`), `path.resolve` leaves the upper pointers intact and allows the user to move beyond the root folder defined for that user. We did not take that into account when creating the path resolve function.

    ### Workarounds

    There are no workarounds for windows servers. Hosting the server on a different OS mitigates the issue.

    [ftp-srv][1] is a Modern, extensible FTP Server

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-side Request

    elsewhere.
