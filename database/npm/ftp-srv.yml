  title: Server-Side Request Forgery
  description: All versions of `ftp-srv` are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery
    (SSRF). The package fails to prevent remote clients to access other resources
    in the network, for example when connecting to the server through telnet. This
    allows attackers to access any network resources available to the server, including
    private resources in the hosting environment.
