  title: Command Injection
  description: "Versions of `ascii-art` before 1.4.4 are vulnerable to command injection.
    This is exploitable when user input is passed into the argument of the `ascii-art
    preview` command. \n\n\nExample Proof of concept:\n`ascii-art preview 'doom\";
    touch /tmp/malicious; echo \"'`\n\nGiven that the input is passed on the command
    line and none of the api methods are vulnerable to this,  the likely exploitation
    vector is when the ascii-art comment is being called programmatically using something
    like `execFile`."
