  title: Improper Certificate Validation
  description: Version 1.2.0 of `mongodb-client-encryption` does not perform correct
    validation of the KMS server’s certificate. This vulnerability in combination
    with a privileged network position active MITM attack could result in interception
    of traffic between the Node.js driver and the KMS service rendering client-side
    field level encryption (CSFLE) ineffective. This issue was discovered during internal
    testing and affects mongodb-client-encryption module version 1.2.0, which was
    available from 2021-Jan-29 and deprecated in the NPM Registry on 2021-Feb-04.
    This vulnerability does not impact driver traffic payloads with CSFLE-supported
    key services from applications residing inside the AWS, GCP, and Azure nework
    fabrics due to compensating controls in these environments. This issue does not
    impact driver workloads that don’t use Field Level Encryption.
