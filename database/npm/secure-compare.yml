  title: Insecure Comparison
  description: |
    [secure-compare][1] is a node implementation of constant-time comparison
    algorithm to prevent timing attacks for Node.js. In versions prior to
    3.0.1, the `compare` function made sure that the length of the two
    arguments is the same, and then mistakenly compared the first argument
    to itself, meaning that the function would return true for any two
    arguments of the same length.
