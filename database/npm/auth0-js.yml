    [`auth0-js`][1] is a Client Side Javascript toolkit for Auth0 API.

    A cross-origin vulnerability has been discovered in the Auth0 auth0.js
    library affecting versions &lt; 8.12. This vulnerability allows an
    attacker to acquire authenticated user\'s tokens and invoke services on
    a user\'s behalf if the target site or application uses a popup callback
    page with `auth0.popup.callback()`.

    [auth0-js][1] is a client Side Javascript toolkit for Auth0 API.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF) due to mishandling the case where the authorization
    response lacks the state parameter.

  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [auth0-js][1] is a Client Side Javascript toolkit for Auth0 API.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF) attacks if the Legacy Lock API flag is enabled.

    Once the user credentials are verified, an HTML form is rendered into
    the user’s browser. A JSON Web Token (JWT) is POSTed to the
    `/login/callback` endpoint, and it maintains state regarding the
    identity of the user. Due to the lack of session binding, this form post
    is susceptible to CSRF. An attacker with valid user credentials at an
    Auth0 tenant can use them to gain such a form, and then employ
    techniques such as social engineering or clickjacking to have a victim’s
    browser execute it.

    [auth0-js][1] is a Client Side Javascript toolkit for Auth0 API.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege Escalation
    via the `parseHash` method. It did not properly validate the `JWT`
    audience, and therefore allowed tokens intended for one tenant to be
    used at another.
