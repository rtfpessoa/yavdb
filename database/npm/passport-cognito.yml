  title: Improper Authorization
  description: All versions of `passport-cognito` are vulnerable to Improper Authorization.
    The package fails to properly scope the variables containing authorization information,
    such as access token, refresh token and ID token. This causes a race condition
    where simultaneous authenticated users may receive authorization tokens for a
    different user. This would allow a user to take actions on another user's behalf.
