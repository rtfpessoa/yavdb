  title: Arbitrary Code Injection
  description: |
    [wxchangba][1] is a Campus light application based on node.js and WeChat
    jssdk.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Injection. The package does not validate user input for the
    `reqPostMaterial` function, thereby passing unsanitized contents of the
    `file` parameter to an exec call. This could potentially allow attackers
    to run arbitrary commands in the system.
