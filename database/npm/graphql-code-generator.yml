  title: Insecure Default Configuration
  description: Versions of `graphql-code-generator` prior to 0.18.2 have an Insecure
    Default Configuration. The packages sets `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` to 0,
    disabling certificate verification for the entire project. This results in Insecure
    Communication for the process.

  title: Insecure Default Configuration
  description: |
    [graphql-code-generator][1] is a tool that generates code out of your
    GraphQL schema.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Default
    Configuration. The `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` environment variable
    is set to the value 0 in all versions of the package disabling
    certificate verification. This flaw can be exploited by a
    Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacker, resulting in an attacker able to view
    a victim\'s HTTPS traffic.

    It should be noted that during the release of graphql-code-generator
    version 1.1.0, the CLI component was amended to be a separate package
    \"@graphql-codegen/cli\".
