  description: "Versions 2.x.x and earlier of `paypal-ipn` are affected by a validation
    bypass vulnerability. \n\npaypal-ipn uses the `test_ipn` parameter (which is set
    by the PayPal IPN simulator) to determine if it should use the production PayPal
    site or the sandbox.\n\nA motivated attacker could craft a request string using
    the simulator to fool the application into entering the sandbox mode, potentially
    allowing purchases without valid payment."

  title: Validation bypass
  description: |-
    When validating a request, it switches between PayPal's main site or the sandbox depending on the presence of the test_ipn parameter, which is set by PayPal's IPN simulator. As I understand, there is nothing stopping people from abusing this tool and sending fraudulent requests.

    With a bit of time, an attacker could craft a request using the simulator that would fool any application which does not explicitly check for test_ipn in production. I see two solutions for this issue:

    It is mentioned in bold in the docs, that developers should check for test_ipn.
    This logic is made explicit - the verify function could take a parameter like { sandbox: true } and only then switch to the sandbox URL for validating requests.
