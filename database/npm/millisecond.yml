  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)][1] vulnerability exists
    in `milliseconds` module, affecting version 0.1.1 and below.

    `milliseconds`, the milliseconds conversion utility is used to convert
    times to milliseconds. The regular expression used by the function to
    parse the time is vulnerable to denial of service attack, where
    extremely long strings that are passed to `milliseconds()` can take long
    time to process and as a result block the event loop for that period.

    \n\"The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of
    Service attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression
    implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work
    very slowly (exponentially related to input size). An attacker can then
    cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme
    situations and then hang for a very long time.\" \[1\]
