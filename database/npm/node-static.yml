  title: Unauthorized File Access
  description: All versions of `node-static` are vulnerable to Unauthorized File Access.
    The package fails to prevent access to files outside of the served folder if the
    filename begins with the name of the served folder. For example if an application
    is serving the folder `./public`, a file such as `./public.txt` is served. The
    expected behavior is for only files inside `./public` to be served. This allows
    attackers to access files served outside of the intended folder.

  title: Open Redirect
  description: 'All versions of `node-static` are vulnerable to Open Redirect. The
    package fails to sanitize URLs and may redirect users to domains passed through
    the URL. The possible redirect domains are restricted to hosts whose name matches
    a served folder from the application. For example if the application serves the
    folder `./public` and has a folder `./public/example.com`, accessing `localhost:8080//example.com`
    redirects to `https://www.example.com/`. '

  title: Denial of Service
  description: All versions of `node-static` are vulnerable to a Denial of Service.
    The package fails to catch an exception when user input includes null bytes. This
    allows attackers to access `http://host/%00` and crash the server.
