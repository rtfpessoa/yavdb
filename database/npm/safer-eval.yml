  title: Sandbox Breakout / Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: Versions of `safer-eval` prior to 1.3.4 are vulnerable to Sandbox Escape
    leading to Remote Code Execution. A payload using constructor properties can escape
    the sandbox and execute arbitrary code. For example, evaluating he string `console.constructor.constructor('return
    process')().env` prints `process.env` to the console.

  title: Sandbox Breakout / Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: All versions of `safer-eval` are vulnerable to Sandbox Escape leading
    to Remote Code Execution. It is possible to escape the sandbox by forcing exceptions
    recursively in the evaluated code. This may allow attacker to execute arbitrary
    code in the system.

  title: Sandbox Breakout / Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: All versions of `safer-eval` are vulnerable to Sandbox Escape leading
    to Remote Code Execution. The package fails to restrict access to the main context
    and is not suited to process arbitrary user input. This may allow attackers to
    execute arbitrary code in the system.
