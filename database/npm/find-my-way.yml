  title: Web Cache Poisoning
  description: |+
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning.
    It accepts the `Accept-Version` header by default, and if versioned
    routes are not being used, this could lead to a denial of service.
    `Accept-Version` can be used as an unkeyed header in a cache poisoning
    attack.
