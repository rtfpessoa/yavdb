  title: SQL Injection
  description: Versions of `connect-pg-simple` are vulnerable to SQL Injection. The
    `PGStore.prototype.quotedTable` function allows for the query to be manipulated
    if the input has double quotes through the `schemaName` or `tableName` variables.
    These variables are passed to the constructor and are unlikely to be controlled
    by user-input. If they are controlled by user-input it could allow attackers to
    execute arbitrary SQL queries.

  title: SQL Injection
  description: |
    [connect-pg-simple][1] is a minimal PostgreSQL session store for
    Express/Connect.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL Injection within
    `PGStore.prototype.quotedTable` function where user input is wrapped
    using double quotes. If the schemaName is set to `'web".session WHERE
    $1=$1;--`, it is possible to wipe the web.session table every time the
    prune process runs.
