  title: Insecure Credential Storage
  description: |
    [web3][1] is a JavaScript API which connects to the Generic JSON RPC
    spec.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Credential
    Storage. The current implementation of web3.js could result in wallet
    decryption under certain circumstances. When a wallet is saved and
    encrypted into local storage, a private key is needed to load the
    wallet. However, this private key is available via LocalStorage and is
    readable in plaintext on a webpage after a wallet is loaded.

    This implementation could be abused by an attacker through client-side
    attacks such as Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and could result in theft of
    a user\'s wallet private key.
