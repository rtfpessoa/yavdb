  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [ssb-server][1] is a network protocol layer for secure-scuttlebutt

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The `get()` method is supposed to only decrypt messages when
    explicitly asked, however a bug exists where it decrypts any message
    that it can. This means that it returns the decrypted content of private
    messages, which a malicious peer could use to get access to private
    data. This only affects peers who also have private messages, and is
    only known to be exploitable if you\'re also running `SSB-OOO` (default
    in SSB-Server), which exposes a thin wrapper around `get()` to anonymous
    peers.
