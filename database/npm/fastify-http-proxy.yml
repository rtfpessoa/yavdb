  title: Prefix escape
  description: |-
    In `fastify-http-proxy` before version 4.3.1, by crafting a specific URL, it is possible to escape the prefix of the proxied backend service.
    If the base url of the proxied server is /pub/, a user expect that accessing /priv on the target service would not be possible. Unfortunately, it is.
