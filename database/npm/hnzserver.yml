  title: Arbitrary File Read
  description: "[hnzserver][1] is a static server.\n\nAffected versions of this package
    are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read.\nPath traversal attack (also known as directory
    traversal) aims to access\nfiles and directories that are stored outside the web
    root folder. By\nmanipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash
    (../)”\nsequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be\npossible
    to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system\nincluding application
    source code or configuration and critical system\nfiles.\n\n### PoC by lightangel1412
    \  {#poc-by-lightangel1412}\n\n* Install the module\n\n`npm install -g hnzserver`\n\n*
    Run \\'hnzserver in \\\"~/Desktop\\\" directory :\n  \n      root@kali:~/Desktop#
