  title: Command Injection
  description: All versions of `npm-git-publish` are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The package fails to sanitize input and passes it directly to an `execSync` call,
    which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system. The `publish`
    function is vulnerable through the `gitRemoteUrl` variable.
