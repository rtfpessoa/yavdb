  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [yarn][1] is a package for dependency management.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM). Npm credentials such as `_authToken` were found to be sent over
    clear text when processing scoped packages that are listed as resolved.
    This could allow a suitably positioned attacker to eavesdrop and
    compromise the sent credentials.

  title: Arbitrary File Write
  description: |
    [yarn][1] is a package for dependency management.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Write. The package install functionality can be abused to generate
    arbitrary symlinks on the host filesystem by using specially crafted
    `bin` keys. Existing files could be overwritten depending on the current
    user permission set.

  title: Arbitrary File Overwrite
  description: |
    [yarn][1] is a package for dependency management.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Overwrite. It is possible for a malicious package, upon install, to
    write to any path on the filesystem even when the `--ignore-scripts`
    option is set. This occurs due to symlinks not being correctly unpacked
    as part of the Yarn install process.

  title: Improper Integrity Checks
  description: |
    [yarn][1] is a package for dependency management.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Integrity
    Checks. It allows to pollute yarn cache via a crafted `yarn.lock` file
    and place a malicious package into cache under any name/version,
    bypassing both integrity and hash checks in `yarn.lock` so that any
    future installs of that package will install the fake version
    (regardless of integrity and hashes).
