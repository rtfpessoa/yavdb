    [`mathjs`][1] is an extensive math library for JavaScript and Node.js.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution.

    The expression parser in mathjs uses the `eval` and the `new Function`
    methods insecurely which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
    code on the remote server.

    The expression parser in mathjs uses the `eval` and the `new Function`
    methods insecurely which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary

    this is due to an incomplete fix for [npm:mathjs:20170331][2].

    [`mathjs`][1] is an extensive math library for JavaScript and Node.js.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. The `isSafeMethod` was able to call other methods (like bind)
    which is not allowed and could cause code execution on the remote
    server.

    [`mathjs`][1] is an extensive math library for JavaScript and Node.js

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution via `typed-function`. A malicious user could possibly execute
    arbitrary code in the JavaScript engine, by creating a typed function
    with JavaScript code in the name.
