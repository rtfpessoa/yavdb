  title: Sanitization bypass using HTML Entities
  description: "Affected versions of `marked` are susceptible to a cross-site scripting
    vulnerability in link components when `sanitize:true` is configured. \n\n## Proof
    of Concept\n\nThis flaw exists because link URIs containing HTML entities get
    processed in an abnormal manner. Any HTML Entities get parsed on a best-effort
    basis and included in the resulting link, while if that parsing fails that character
    is omitted.\n\nFor example:\n\nA link URI such as\n```\njavascript&#x58document;alert&#40;1&#41;\n```\nRenders
    a valid link that when clicked will execute `alert(1)`."

  description: "[marked][1] is a markdown parser and compiler. Built for speed.\n\nAffected
    versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expressions\nDenial of Service
    (ReDoS) when certain types of input are passed in to\nbe parsed.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://github.com/markedjs/marked\n\\nDenial
    of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at\nmaking a system
    inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There\nare many types of DoS
    attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network\npipes to the system by generating
    a large volume of traffic from many\nmachines (a Distributed Denial of Service
    - DDoS - attack) to sending\ncrafted requests that cause a system to crash or
    take a disproportional\namount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial
    of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of\nService attack. Regular expressions
    are incredibly powerful, but they\naren\\'t very intuitive and can ultimately
    end up making it easy for\nattackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the
    following regular expression as an example:\n\n    regex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n\nThis
    regular expression accomplishes the following:\n\n* `A` The string must start
    with the letter \\'A\\'\n* `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A
    with either the\n  letter \\'B\\' or some number of occurrences of the letter
    \\'C\\' (the\n  `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section\n
    \ states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n* `D` Finally,
    we ensure this section of the string ends with a \\'D\\'\n\nThe expression would
    match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD`\nand `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases,
    it doesn\\'t take very long for a regex engine to find a\nmatch:\n\n    $ time
    node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n    0.04s user
    0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n    \n    $ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n
    \   1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n\nThe entire process of testing
    it against a 30 characters long string\ntakes around ~52ms. But when given an
    invalid string, it takes nearly\ntwo seconds to complete the test, over ten times
    as long as it took to\ntest a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to
    the way regular\nexpressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very
    similarly (with minor differences).\nThe engine will match the first possible
    way to accept the current\ncharacter and proceed to the next one. If it then fails
    to match the\nnext one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to
    digest\nthe previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to\nfind
    out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters\nhave multiple
    valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can\nbecome very large, resulting
    in what is known as *catastrophic\nbacktracking*.\n\nLet\\'s look at how our expression
    runs into this problem, using a\nshorter string: \\\"ACCCX\\\". While it seems
    fairly straightforward, there\nare still four different ways that the engine could
    match those three\nC\\'s:\n\n1.  CCC\n2.  CC+C\n3.  C+CC\n4.  C+C+C.\n\nThe engine
    has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them\npotentially match
    against the expression. When you combine that with the\nother steps the engine
    must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger][1] to\nsee the engine has to take a
    total of 38 steps before it can determine\nthe string doesn\\'t match.\n\nFrom
    there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string\njust continues
    to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C\\'s | Number of steps |\n|----------\n| ACCCX
    | 3 | 38 |\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71 |\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136 |\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14
    | 65,553 |\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C\\'s, the engine has to take
    over\n65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme\nsituations
    can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to\ninput size, as shown
    above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and\ncan cause the service to excessively
    consume CPU, resulting in a Denial\nof Service.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://regex101.com/debugger\n"

  title: Content & Code Injection (XSS)
  description: |+
    [`marked`][1] is a markdown parser and compiler used for rendering
    markdown content to html.

    It is vulnerable to content injection attack allowing the attacker to
    bypass its output sanitization (`sanitize: true`) protection. Using the
    [HTML Coded Character Set][2], attackers can inject `javascript:` code
    snippets into the output. For example, the following input
    `javascript&#x58document;alert(1)` will result in `alert(1)` being
    executed when the user clicks on the link.

    [2]: https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_13.html#SEC13
    \nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a
    legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as
    originating from a trusted source.

    This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web
    application then delivers that data to its users along with other
    trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly
    executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side
    languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that
    are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.

    ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is
    exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this
    manipulation is the top method for securing code against this
    vulnerability.

    Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and
    particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those
    characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example,
    in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in
    order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while
    within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious
    content is injected into an application that escapes special characters
    and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those
    characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser
    if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this
    way the attempted attack is diverted.

    The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP
    HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to
    expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and
    functionality and deliver malware.

    ### Types of attacks   {#types-of-attacks}

    There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:

    | Type | Origin | Description |
    |----------
    | **Stored** | Server | The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link. |
    | **Reflected** | Server | The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. |
    | **DOM-based** | Client | The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data. |
    | **Mutated** |  | The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters. |

    ### Affected environments   {#affected-environments}

    The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:

    * Web servers
    * Application servers
    * Web application environments

    ### How to prevent   {#how-to-prevent}

    This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically
    protect your code:

    * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back,
      ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing
      anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters
      during searches.
    * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces
      to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.
    * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.
    * Redirect invalid requests.
    * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP
      addresses, and invalidate those sessions.
    * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to
      disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.
    * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your
      code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.

  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via Data URIs
  description: |+
    [`marked`][1] is a markdown parser and compiler used for rendering
    markdown content to html.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS). Data URIs enable embedding small files in line in HTML documents,
    provided in the URL itself. Attackers can craft malicious web pages
    containing either HTML or script code that utilizes the data URI scheme,
    allowing them to bypass access controls or steal sensitive information.

    An example of data URI used to deliver javascript code. The data holds
    `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` tag in base64 encoded format.

    versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular expression\nDenial of Service

    around 6 seconds matching time).\n\n\n\n[1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked\n\\nDenial
    of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at\nmaking a system
    inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There\nare many types of DoS
    attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network\npipes to the system by generating
    a large volume of traffic from many\nmachines (a Distributed Denial of Service
    - DDoS - attack) to sending\ncrafted requests that cause a system to crash or
    take a disproportional\namount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial
    of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of\nService attack. Regular expressions
    are incredibly powerful, but they\naren\\'t very intuitive and can ultimately
    end up making it easy for\nattackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the
    following regular expression as an example:\n\n    regex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n\nThis
    regular expression accomplishes the following:\n\n* `A` The string must start
    with the letter \\'A\\'\n* `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A
    with either the\n  letter \\'B\\' or some number of occurrences of the letter
    \\'C\\' (the\n  `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section\n
    \ states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n* `D` Finally,
    we ensure this section of the string ends with a \\'D\\'\n\nThe expression would
    match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD`\nand `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases,
    it doesn\\'t take very long for a regex engine to find a\nmatch:\n\n    $ time
    node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n    0.04s user
    0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n    \n    $ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n
    \   1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n\nThe entire process of testing
    it against a 30 characters long string\ntakes around ~52ms. But when given an
    invalid string, it takes nearly\ntwo seconds to complete the test, over ten times
    as long as it took to\ntest a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to
    the way regular\nexpressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very
    similarly (with minor differences).\nThe engine will match the first possible
    way to accept the current\ncharacter and proceed to the next one. If it then fails
    to match the\nnext one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to
    digest\nthe previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to\nfind
    out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters\nhave multiple
    valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can\nbecome very large, resulting
    in what is known as *catastrophic\nbacktracking*.\n\nLet\\'s look at how our expression
    runs into this problem, using a\nshorter string: \\\"ACCCX\\\". While it seems
    fairly straightforward, there\nare still four different ways that the engine could
    match those three\nC\\'s:\n\n1.  CCC\n2.  CC+C\n3.  C+CC\n4.  C+C+C.\n\nThe engine
    has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them\npotentially match
    against the expression. When you combine that with the\nother steps the engine
    must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger][1] to\nsee the engine has to take a
    total of 38 steps before it can determine\nthe string doesn\\'t match.\n\nFrom
    there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string\njust continues
    to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C\\'s | Number of steps |\n|----------\n| ACCCX
    | 3 | 38 |\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71 |\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136 |\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14
    | 65,553 |\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C\\'s, the engine has to take
    over\n65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme\nsituations
    can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to\ninput size, as shown

  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
  description: |
    [marked][1] is a low-level compiler for parsing markdown without caching
    or blocking for long periods of time.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression
    Denial of Service (ReDoS). Input to the `host` variable is vulnerable
    when input contains parenthesis in link URIs, coupled with a high number
    of link tokens in a single line.
