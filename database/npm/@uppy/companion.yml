  title: Server-Side Request Forgery
  description: 'Versions of `@uppy/companion` prior to 1.9.3 are vulnerable to Server-Side
    Request Forgery (SSRF). The `get` route passes the user-controlled variable `req.body.url`
    to a GET request without sanitizing the value. This allows attackers to inject
    arbitrary URLs and make GET requests on behalf of the server. '
