  title: Denial of Service
  description: Versions of `parse-server` prior to 3.4.1 are vulnerable to Denial
    of Service (DoS). POST requests to `/parse/classes/_Audience` (or other volatile
    classes) cause the server to respond with a `500 Internal Server Error` for any
    subsequent POST requests.

  title: Sensitive Data Exposure
  description: Versions of `parse-server` prior to 3.6.0 are vulnerable to Sensitive
    Data Exposure. The package throws the error `ParseError.ACCOUNT_ALREADY_LINKED(208)`
    before the authentication controller throws `ParseError.SESSION_MISSING(206)`.
    This allows unauthenticated attackers to enumerate user account by guessing ids
    and retrieving user information.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [parse-server][1] is a version of the Parse backend that can be deployed
    to any infrastructure that can run Node.js.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). If a POST request is made to `/parse/classes/_Audience` (or other
    volatile class), any subsuquent POST requests result in an internal
    server error (500).

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Account Enumeration
  description: |
    [parse-server][1] is a version of the Parse backend that can be deployed
    to any infrastructure that can run Node.js.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Account Enumeration.
    `ParseError.ACCOUNT_ALREADY_LINKED(208)` is thrown before the
    `AuthController`checks the password and throws a
    `ParseError.SESSION_MISSING(206)` for Insufficient auth. An attacker can
    guess ids and get information about linked accounts and email addresses.
