  title: Forgeable Public/Private Tokens
  description: "Affected versions of the `jws` package allow users to select what
    algorithm the server will use to verify a provided JWT. A malicious actor can
    use this behaviour to arbitrarily modify the contents of a JWT while still passing
    verification. For the common use case of the JWT as a bearer token, the end result
    is a complete authentication bypass with minimal effort.\n\n"

  title: Forgeable Public/Private Tokens
  description: |
    [`jws`][1] is an implementation of JSON Web Signatures. Affected
    versions of this package are vulnerable to an Authentication Bypass
    attack, due to the \"algorithm\" not being enforced in `jws.verify()`.
    Attackers are given the opportunity to choose the algorithm sent to the
    server and generate signatures with arbitrary contents. The server
    expects an asymmetric key (RSA) but is sent a symmetric key (HMAC-SHA)
    with RSA\'s public key, so instead of going through a key validation
    process, the server will think the public key is actually an HMAC
    private key.
