  description: |
    [private-ip][1] is a Check if IP address is private.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-side Request
    Forgery (SSRF). An attacker can perform a large range of requests to
    ARIN reserved IP ranges, resulting in an indeterminable number of
    critical attack vectors, allowing remote attackers to request
    server-side resources or potentially execute arbitrary code through
    various SSRF techniques.
