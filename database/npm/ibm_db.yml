  description: "Affected versions of `ibm_db` insecurely download resources over HTTP.
    \r\n\r\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, they
    can modify or read such resources at will. While the exact severity of impact
    for a vulnerability like this is highly variable and depends on the behavior of
    the package itself, it ranges from being able to read sensitive information all
    the way up to and including remote code execution."
