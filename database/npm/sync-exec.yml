  title: Tmp files readable by other users
  description: Affected versions of `sync-exec` use files located in `/tmp/` to buffer
    command results before returning values. As `/tmp/` is almost always set with
    world readable permissions, this may allow low privilege users on the system to
    read the results of commands run via `sync-exec` under a higher privilege user.

  title: Insecure use of Tmp files
  description: |
    [`sync-exec`][1] is an fs.execSync replacement for node &lt;0.12.

    Affected versions of this package use tmp directories in an insecure
    way. The file to create will allways return `true`, regardess if the
    directory already exists and/or belongs to another user. Any user on the
    server may read the contents of this tmp file and may expose
    confidential information to an attacker.
