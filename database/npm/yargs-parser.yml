  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: "Affected versions of `yargs-parser` are vulnerable to prototype pollution.
    Arguments are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype
    of `Object`, causing the addition or modification of an existing property that
    will exist on all objects.  \nParsing the argument `--foo.__proto__.bar baz'`
    adds a `bar` property with value `baz` to all objects. This is only exploitable
    if attackers have control over the arguments being passed to `yargs-parser`.\n"

  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: |
    [yargs-parser][1] is a mighty option parser used by yargs.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.
    The library could be tricked into adding or modifying properties of
    `Object.prototype` using a `__proto__` payload.

    Our research team checked several attack vectors to verify this
    vulnerability:

    1.  It could be used for [privilege escalation][2].
    2.  The library could be used to parse user input received from
        different sources:
        * terminal emulators
        * system calls from other code bases
        * CLI RPC servers
