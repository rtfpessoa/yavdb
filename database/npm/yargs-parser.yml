  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: |
    [yargs-parser][1] is a mighty option parser used by yargs.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.
    The library could be tricked into adding or modifying properties of
    `Object.prototype` using a `__proto__` payload.

    Our research team checked several attack vectors to verify this
    vulnerability:

    1.  It could be used for [privilege escalation][2].
    2.  The library could be used to parse user input received from
        different sources:
        * terminal emulators
        * system calls from other code bases
        * CLI RPC servers
