  title: Failure to sanitize quotes which can lead to sql injection
  description: |-
    All versions of `squel` are vulnerable to sql injection.

    The `squel` package does not properly escape user provided input when provided using the `setFields` method. This could lead to sql injection if the query was then executed.

    Proof of concept demonstrating the injection of a single quote into a generated sql statement from user provided input.
    ```
    > console.log(squel.insert().into('buh').setFields({foo: "bar'baz"}).toString());
    INSERT INTO buh (foo) VALUES ('bar'baz')
    ```
