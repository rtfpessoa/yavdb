  title: SIgnature Verification Bypass
  description: Versions of `jwt-simple` prior to 0.5.3 are vulnerable to Signature
    Verification Bypass. If no algorithm is specified in the `decode()` function,
    the packages uses the algorithm in the JWT to decode tokens. This allows an attacker
    to create a HS256 (symmetric algorithm) JWT with the server's public key as secret,
    and the package will verify it as HS256 instead of RS256 (asymmetric algorithm).

  title: Forgeable Public/Private Tokens
  description: 'Affected versions of the `jwt-simple` package allow users to select
    what algorithm the server will use to verify a provided JWT. A malicious actor
    can use this behaviour to arbitrarily modify the contents of a JWT while still
    passing verification. For the common use case of the JWT, the end result is a
    complete authentication bypass with minimal effort.

  title: Forgeable public/private tokens
  description: |
    [\'jwt-simple\'][1] is a `JSON Web Token` encode and decode module.
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an Authentication
    Bypass attack, due to the \"algorithm\" not being enforced. Attackers
    are given the opportunity to choose the algorithm sent to the server and
    generate signatures with arbitrary contents. The server expects an
    asymmetric key (RSA) but is sent a symmetric key (HMAC-SHA) with RSA\'s
    public key, so instead of going through a key validation process, the
    server will think the public key is actually an HMAC private key.
