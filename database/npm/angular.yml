  title: Injection Attack
  description: AngularJS offers frontend developers a scope object that attempts to
    isolate global variables from the templating work-flow and keep things lean and
    "Angular-only". This makes sense - and to be fair, the AngularJS documentation
    explicitly states that the scope object is not considered to be a sandbox. And
    indeed it is none. With a simple JavaScript trick one can break out of this "non-sandbox"
    and execute arbitrary code in window and other host objects.

  title: Clickjacking
  description: |
    [angular][1] is a package that lets you write client-side web
    applications as if you had a smarter browser. It also lets you use HTML
    as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express
    your application’s components clearly and succinctly.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Clickjacking. By
    enabling the SVG setting without taking other precautions, you might
    expose your application to click-hijacking attacks. In these attacks,
    sanitized SVG elements could be positioned outside of the containing
    element and be rendered over other elements on the page (e.g. a login
    link). Such behavior can then result in phishing incidents.

    To protect against these, explicitly setup `overflow: hidden` css rule
    for all potential SVG tags within the sanitized content:

        .rootOfTheIncludedContent svg {
          overflow: hidden !important;
        }
    {: .language-ruby}

    applications as if you had a smarter browser. It also lets you use HTML
    as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express
    your application’s components clearly and succinctly.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS). DOM event handlers await events to occur (e.g. onclick,
    onkeypress, etc) and execute arbitrary Javascript code in accordance to
    the event. By default, interpolations inside DOM event handlers are
    disallowed. Using an interpolation for such handlers means that the
    interpolated value is a JS string being evaluated. Storing or generating
    such strings is error prone and likely leads to a Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS) vulnerability if you\'re not careful. On the other hand, ng-click
    and such event handlers evaluate Angular expressions that are a lot
    safer (e.g. No direct access to global objects - only scope), cleaner
    and harder to exploit.

    To migrate the code follow the example below: Before:

        JS:   scope.foo = 'alert(1)';
    {: .language-js}

        HTML: <div onclick="{{foo}}">
    {: .language-html}

    After:

        JS:   scope.foo = function() { alert(1); }
    {: .language-js}

        HTML: <div ng-click="foo()">
    {: .language-html}

  description: |
    [angular][1] is a package that lets you write client-side web
    applications as if you had a smarter browser. It also lets you use HTML
    as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express
    your application’s components clearly and succinctly.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS) Concatenating expressions makes it hard to reason about whether
    some combination of concatenated values are unsafe to use and could
    easily lead to XSS. By requiring that a single expression be used for
    `*[src/ng-src]` such as `iframe[src]`, `object[src]`, etc. (but not
    `img[src/ng-src]` since that value is sanitized), it is ensured that the
    value that\'s used is assigned or constructed by some JS code somewhere
    that is more testable or make it obvious that you bound the value to
    some user controlled value. This helps reduce the load when auditing for
    XSS issues.

    To migrate your code, follow the example below:

    Before:

        JS:
        scope.baseUrl = 'page';
        scope.a = 1;
        scope.b = 2;
    {: .language-js}

        HTML:
        <!-- Are a and b properly escaped here? Is baseUrl
         controlled by user? -->
        <iframe src="{{baseUrl}}?a={{a}&b={{b}}">
    {: .language-html}

    After:

        JS:
        var baseUrl = "page";
        scope.getIframeSrc = function() {
          // There are obviously better ways to do this.  The
          // key point is that one will think about this and do
          // it the right way.
          var qs = ["a", "b"].map(function(value, name) {
          return encodeURIComponent(name) + "=" +
         encodeURIComponent(value);
        }).join("&");
          // baseUrl isn't on scope so it isn't bound to a user
          // controlled value.
          return baseUrl + "?" + qs;
        }
    {: .language-js}

        HTML: <iframe src="{{getIframeSrc()}}">Before:
    {: .language-html}

    \##Details A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks
    a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as
    originating from a trusted source.

    This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web
    application then delivers that data to its users along with other
    trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly
    executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side
    languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that
    are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.

    ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is
    exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this
    manipulation is the top method for securing code against this
    vulnerability.

    Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and
    particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those
    characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example,
    in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in
    order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while
    within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious
    content is injected into an application that escapes special characters
    and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those
    characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser
    if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this
    way the attempted attack is diverted.

    The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP
    HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to
    expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and
    functionality and deliver malware.

    ### Types of attacks   {#types-of-attacks}

    There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:

    | Type | Origin | Description |
    |----------
    | **Stored** | Server | The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link. |
    | **Reflected** | Server | The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. |
    | **DOM-based** | Client | The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data. |
    | **Mutated** |  | The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters. |

    ### Affected environments   {#affected-environments}

    The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:

    * Web servers
    * Application servers
    * Web application environments

    ### How to prevent   {#how-to-prevent}

    This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically
    protect your code:

    * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back,
      ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing
      anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters
      during searches.
    * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces
      to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.
    * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.
    * Redirect invalid requests.
    * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP
      addresses, and invalidate those sessions.
    * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to
      disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.
    * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your

  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |+
    [angular][1] is a package that lets you write client-side web
    applications as if you had a smarter browser. It also lets you use HTML
    as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express
    your application’s components clearly and succinctly.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS) due to unsanitized URIs in `ng-srcset`.



    [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular
    \nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a
    legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as
    originating from a trusted source.

    This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web
    application then delivers that data to its users along with other
    trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly
    executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side
    languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that
    are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.

    ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is
    exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this
    manipulation is the top method for securing code against this
    vulnerability.

    Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and
    particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those
    characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example,
    in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in
    order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while
    within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious
    content is injected into an application that escapes special characters
    and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those
    characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser
    if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this
    way the attempted attack is diverted.

    The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP
    HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to
    expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and
    functionality and deliver malware.

    ### Types of attacks   {#types-of-attacks}

    There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:

    | Type | Origin | Description |
    |----------
    | **Stored** | Server | The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link. |
    | **Reflected** | Server | The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. |
    | **DOM-based** | Client | The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data. |
    | **Mutated** |  | The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters. |

    ### Affected environments   {#affected-environments}

    The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:

    * Web servers
    * Application servers
    * Web application environments

    ### How to prevent   {#how-to-prevent}

    This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically
    protect your code:

    * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back,
      ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing
      anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters
      during searches.
    * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces
      to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.
    * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.
    * Redirect invalid requests.
    * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP
      addresses, and invalidate those sessions.
    * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to
      disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.
    * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your
      code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.

  title: Unsafe Object Deserialization
  description: |
    [angular][1] is a package that lets you write client-side web
    applications as if you had a smarter browser. It also lets you use HTML
    as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express
    your application’s components clearly and succinctly.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Unsafe Object
    Deserialization. ## POC The exploitable code:

        hasOwnProperty.constructor.prototype.valueOf = valueOf.call;
            ["a", "alert(1)"].sort(hasOwnProperty.constructor);
    {: .language-js}

    The exploit:

    * 1.  `Array.sort` takes a comparison function and passes it 2
          parameters to compare.
      2.  It then calls `.valueOf()` if the result is not a primitive.

    * The `Function` object conveniently accepts two string arguments so so
      it can be used to construct a function. However, this doesn\'t do much
      unless it can be executed.
    * The `valueOf` function on `Function.prototype` was set to
      `Function.prototype.call`. This causes the function constructed to be
      executed when sort calls `.valueOf()` on the result of the comparison.

    \nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of
    bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent
    through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of
    bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for
    communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence
    (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part
    of popular protocols like *Remote Method Invocation (RMI)*, *Java
    Management Extension (JMX)*, *Java Messaging System (JMS)*, *Action
    Message Format (AMF)*, *Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState*, etc.

    *Deserialization of untrusted data* ([CWE-502][1]), is when the
    application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying
    that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control
    the state or the flow of the execution.

    Java deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest
    in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be
    abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library
    (Apache Commons Collection)][2]. These classes were used in zero-days
    affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.

    An attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a
    vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted
    data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the
    deserializer, getting the command executed.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution via unsafe svg animation tags.



    [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular
    \nExploit Example:

        <svg>
          <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="?">
            <circle r="400"></circle>
            <animate attributeName="xlink:href" begin="0" from="javascript:alert(1)" to="&" />
          </a>
        </svg>
    {: .language-html}

    Here the anchor\'s href is animated, starting from a value that\'s a
    javascript URI. This allows execution of arbitrary javascript in the
    process. Preventing only the animation of links is tricky, as SVG is
    weird and namespaces aren\'t predictable. The fix is to have the
    sanitizer filter out svg animation tags instead.

    as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express
    your application’s components clearly and succinctly.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to JSONP Callback
    Attack. `JSONP` (JSON with padding) is a method used to request data
    from a server residing in a different domain than the client.

    Any url could perform JSONP requests, allowing full access to the
    browser and the JavaScript context. This can lead to Cross-site
    Scripting.

  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |+
    [angular][1] is a package that lets you write client-side web
    applications as if you had a smarter browser. It also lets you use HTML
    as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express
    your application’s components clearly and succinctly.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS). This error occurs when `$sanitize` sanitizer tries to check the
    input for possible mXSS payload and the verification errors due to the
    input mutating indefinitely. This could be a sign that the payload
    contains code exploiting an mXSS vulnerability in the browser.

    mXSS attack exploit browser bugs that cause some browsers parse a
    certain html strings into DOM, which once serialized doesn\'t match the
    original input. These browser bugs can be exploited by attackers to
    create payload which looks harmless to sanitizers, but due to mutations
    caused by the browser are turned into dangerous code once processed
    after sanitization.



    [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular
    \nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a
    legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as
    originating from a trusted source.

    This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web
    application then delivers that data to its users along with other
    trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly
    executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side
    languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that
    are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.

    ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is
    exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this
    manipulation is the top method for securing code against this
    vulnerability.

    Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and
    particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those
    characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example,
    in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in
    order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while
    within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious
    content is injected into an application that escapes special characters
    and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those
    characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser
    if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this
    way the attempted attack is diverted.

    The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP
    HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to
    expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and
    functionality and deliver malware.

    ### Types of attacks   {#types-of-attacks}

    There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:

    | Type | Origin | Description |
    |----------
    | **Stored** | Server | The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link. |
    | **Reflected** | Server | The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. |
    | **DOM-based** | Client | The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data. |
    | **Mutated** |  | The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters. |

    ### Affected environments   {#affected-environments}

    The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:

    * Web servers
    * Application servers
    * Web application environments

    ### How to prevent   {#how-to-prevent}

    This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically
    protect your code:

    * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back,
      ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing
      anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters
      during searches.
    * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces
      to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.
    * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.
    * Redirect invalid requests.
    * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP
      addresses, and invalidate those sessions.
    * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to
      disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.
    * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your
      code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.
      ## Remediation   {#remediation}

    your application’s components clearly and succinctly.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS) via the SVG `<use>` element. The `<use>` element can reference
    external SVG\'s (same origin) and can include `xlink:href` javascript
    urls or foreign object that can execute XSS. The change disallows
    `<use>` elements in sanitized SVG markup.

    An example of a malicious SVG document would be:

    SVG to sanitize:

        <svg><use xlink:href="test.svg#xss" /></svg>
    {: .language-html}

    External SVG file (test.svg):

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
        <svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
           xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100"
           height="100"
           id="xss">
        <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="javascript:alert(1)">
          <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />
        </a>
        </svg>
    {: .language-html}

    Here the SVG to sanitize loads in the `test.svg` file via the `<use>`
    element. The sanitizer is not able to parse this file, which contains
    malicious executable mark-up. This can only be taken advantage of if the
    external file is available via the same origin restrictions in place.

    By default, `RESOURCE_URL` safe URLs are only allowed from the same
    domain and protocol as the application document.

    Now if a site already has a XSS bug, and uses CSP to protect itself, but
    the user has an extension installed that uses Angular, an attacker can
    load Angular from the extension, and Angular\'s auto-bootstrapping can
    be used to bypass the victim site\'s CSP protection.

    applications as if you had a smarter browser. It also lets you use HTML
    as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express
    your application’s components clearly and succinctly.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS). Browsers mutate attributes values such as `　javascript:alert(1)`
    when they are written to the DOM via `innerHTML` in various vendor
    specific ways. In Chrome (&lt;62), this mutation removed the preceding
    \"whitespace\" resulting in a value that could end up being executed as
    JavaScript.

    Here is an example of what could happen:

        // Code goes here
        var h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
        h1.innerHTML = '<a href="　javascript:alert(1)">CLICKME</a>';
        var innerHTML = h1.innerHTML;
        console.log(innerHTML);
        h1.innerHTML = innerHTML;
    {: .language-js}

    The sanitizer contains a bit of code that triggers this mutation on an
    inert piece of DOM, [before angular sanitizes it][2].

    **Note:** Chrome 62 does not appear to mutate this particular string any
    more, instead it just leaves the \"whitespace\" in place. This probably
    means that Chrome 62 is no longer vulnerable to this specific attack
    vector.

  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |+
    [angular][1] is a package that lets you write client-side web
    applications as if you had a smarter browser. It also lets you use HTML
    as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express
    your application’s components clearly and succinctly.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS) through SVG files if `enableSvg` is set.



    [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular
    \nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a
    legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as
    originating from a trusted source.

    This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web
    application then delivers that data to its users along with other
    trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly
    executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side

    vulnerability.

    Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and
    particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those
    characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example,
    in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in
    order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while
    within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious
    content is injected into an application that escapes special characters
    and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those
    characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser
    if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this
    way the attempted attack is diverted.

    The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP
    HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to
    expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and
    functionality and deliver malware.

    ### Types of attacks   {#types-of-attacks}

    There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:

    | Type | Origin | Description |
    |----------
    | **Stored** | Server | The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link. |
    | **Reflected** | Server | The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. |
    | **DOM-based** | Client | The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data. |
    | **Mutated** |  | The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters. |

    ### Affected environments   {#affected-environments}

    The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:

    * Web servers
    * Application servers
    * Web application environments

    ### How to prevent   {#how-to-prevent}

    This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically
    protect your code:

    * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back,
      ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing
      anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters
      during searches.
    * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces
      to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.
    * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.
    * Redirect invalid requests.
    * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP
      addresses, and invalidate those sessions.
    * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to
      disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.
    * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your
      code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). None



    [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  description: "[angular][1] is a package that lets you write client-side web\napplications
    as if you had a smarter browser. It also lets you use HTML\nas your template language
    and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express\nyour application’s components clearly
    and succinctly.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype
    Pollution.\nThe function `merge()` could be tricked into adding or modifying\nproperties
    of `Object.prototype` using a `__proto__` payload.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular\n\\nDenial
    of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at\nmaking a system
    inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There\nare many types of DoS
    attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network\npipes to the system by generating
    a large volume of traffic from many\nmachines (a Distributed Denial of Service
    - DDoS - attack) to sending\ncrafted requests that cause a system to crash or
    take a disproportional\namount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial
    of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of\nService attack. Regular expressions
    are incredibly powerful, but they\naren\\'t very intuitive and can ultimately
    end up making it easy for\nattackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the
    following regular expression as an example:\n\n    regex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n{: .language-js}\n\nThis
    regular expression accomplishes the following:\n\n* `A` The string must start
    with the letter \\'A\\'\n* `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A
    with either the\n  letter \\'B\\' or some number of occurrences of the letter
    \\'C\\' (the\n  `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section\n
    \ states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n* `D` Finally,
    we ensure this section of the string ends with a \\'D\\'\n\nThe expression would
    match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD`\nand `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases,
    it doesn\\'t take very long for a regex engine to find a\nmatch:\n\n    $ time
    node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n    0.04s user
    0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n    \n    $ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n
    \   1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n{: .language-bash}\n\nThe entire
    process of testing it against a 30 characters long string\ntakes around ~52ms.
    But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly\ntwo seconds to complete the
    test, over ten times as long as it took to\ntest a valid string. The dramatic
    difference is due to the way regular\nexpressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex
    engines will work very similarly (with minor differences).\nThe engine will match
    the first possible way to accept the current\ncharacter and proceed to the next
    one. If it then fails to match the\nnext one, it will backtrack and see if there
    was another way to digest\nthe previous character. If it goes too far down the
    rabbit hole only to\nfind out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many
    characters\nhave multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps
    can\nbecome very large, resulting in what is known as *catastrophic\nbacktracking*.\n\nLet\\'s
    look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a\nshorter string: \\\"ACCCX\\\".
    While it seems fairly straightforward, there\nare still four different ways that
    the engine could match those three\nC\\'s:\n\n1.  CCC\n2.  CC+C\n3.  C+CC\n4.
    \ C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of
    them\npotentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the\nother
    steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger][1] to\nsee the engine
    has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine\nthe string doesn\\'t
    match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string\njust
    continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C\\'s | Number of steps |\n|----------\n|
    ACCCX | 3 | 38 |\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71 |\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136 |\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX
    | 14 | 65,553 |\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C\\'s, the engine has to
    take over\n65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme\nsituations
    can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to\ninput size, as shown
    above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and\ncan cause the service to excessively
    consume CPU, resulting in a Denial\nof Service.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://regex101.com/debugger\n"

  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |+
    [angular][1] is a package that lets you write client-side web
    applications as if you had a smarter browser. It also lets you use HTML
    as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express
    your application’s components clearly and succinctly.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS). The regex-based input HTML replacement may turn sanitized code
    into unsanitized one. Wrapping `<option>` elements in `<select>` ones
    changes parsing behavior, leading to possibly unsanitizing code.



    [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular
    \nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a
    legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as
    originating from a trusted source.

    This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web
    application then delivers that data to its users along with other
    trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly
    executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side
    languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that
    are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.

    ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is
    exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this
    manipulation is the top method for securing code against this
    vulnerability.

    Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and
    particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those
    characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example,
    in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in
    order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while
    within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious
    content is injected into an application that escapes special characters
    and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those
    characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser
    if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this
    way the attempted attack is diverted.

    The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP
    HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to
    expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and
    functionality and deliver malware.

    ### Types of attacks   {#types-of-attacks}

    There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:

    | Type | Origin | Description |
    |----------
    | **Stored** | Server | The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link. |
    | **Reflected** | Server | The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. |
    | **DOM-based** | Client | The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data. |
    | **Mutated** |  | The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters. |

    ### Affected environments   {#affected-environments}

    The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:

    * Web servers
    * Application servers
    * Web application environments

    ### How to prevent   {#how-to-prevent}

    This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically
    protect your code:

    * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back,
      ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing
      anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters
      during searches.
    * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces
      to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.
    * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.
    * Redirect invalid requests.
    * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP
      addresses, and invalidate those sessions.
    * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to
      disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.
    * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your
      code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.
