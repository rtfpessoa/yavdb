  description: All versions of `express-brute` are vulnerable to Rate Limiting Bypass.
    Concurrent requests may lead to race conditions that cause the package to incorrectly
    count requests. This may allow an attacker to bypass the rate limiting provided
    by the package and execute requests without limiting.

  title: Rate Limiting Bypass
  description: |
    [express-brute][1] is a brute-force protection middleware for express
    routes that rate-limits incoming requests, increasing the delay with
    each request in a fibonacci-like sequence.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Rate Limiting Bypass
    due to incorrectly counting the number of requests sent, this allows an
    attacker to bypass the rate-limiting mechanism.
