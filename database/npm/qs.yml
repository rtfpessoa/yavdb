  title: Prototype Pollution Protection Bypass
  description: Affected version of `qs` are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution because
    it is possible to bypass the protection. The `qs.parse` function fails to properly
    prevent an object's prototype to be altered when parsing arbitrary input. Input
    containing `[` or `]` may bypass the prototype pollution protection and alter
    the Object prototype. This allows attackers to override properties that will exist
    in all objects, which may lead to Denial of Service or Remote Code Execution in
    specific circumstances.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [qs][1] is a querystring parser that supports nesting and arrays, with a
    depth limit.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). When parsing a string representing a deeply nested object, qs
    will block the event loop for long periods of time. Such a delay may
    hold up the server\'s resources, keeping it from processing other
    requests in the meantime, thus enabling a Denial-of-Service attack.



    [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  description: |+
    [qs][1] is a querystring parser that supports nesting and arrays, with a
    depth limit.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). During parsing, the `qs` module may create a sparse area (an
    array where no elements are filled), and grow that array to the
    necessary size based on the indices used on it. An attacker can specify
    a high index value in a query string, thus making the server allocate a
    respectively big array. Truly large values can cause the server to run
    out of memory and cause it to crash - thus enabling a Denial-of-Service
    attack.

  title: Prototype Override Protection Bypass
  description: "[qs][1] is a querystring parser that supports nesting and arrays,
    with a\ndepth limit.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype
    Override\nProtection Bypass. By default `qs` protects against attacks that attempt\nto
    overwrite an object\\'s existing prototype properties, such as\n`toString()`,
    `hasOwnProperty()`,etc.\n\nFrom [`qs` documentation][2]\\:\n\n> By default parameters
    that would overwrite properties on the object\n> prototype are ignored, if you
    wish to keep the data from those fields\n> either use plainObjects as mentioned
    above, or set allowPrototypes to\n> true which will allow user input to overwrite
    those properties.\n> WARNING It is generally a bad idea to enable this option
    as it can\n> cause problems when attempting to use the properties that have been\n>
    overwritten. Always be careful with this option.\n\nOverwriting these properties
    can impact application logic, potentially\nallowing attackers to work around security
    controls, modify data, make\nthe application unstable and more.\n\nIn versions
    of the package affected by this vulnerability, it is\npossible to circumvent this
    protection and overwrite prototype\nproperties and functions by prefixing the
    name of the parameter with `[`\nor `]`. e.g. `qs.parse(\"]=toString\")` will return
    `{toString = true}`,\nas a result, calling `toString()` on the object will throw
    an exception.\n\n**Example:**\n\n    qs.parse('toString=foo', { allowPrototypes:
    false })\n    // {}\n    \n    qs.parse(\"]=toString\", { allowPrototypes: false
    })\n    // {toString = true} <== prototype overwritten\n{: .language-js}\n\nFor
