  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: |
    ### Impact

    In affected versions of `mixme` an attacker can add or alter properties of an object via 'proto' through the mutate() and merge() functions. The polluted attribute will be directly assigned to every object in the program. This will put the availability of the program at risk causing a potential denial of service (DoS).

    ### Patches

    The problem is corrected starting with version 0.5.1.

    ### Workarounds
    No
