    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authentication. The module is defined to handle authentication but does
    not validate the JWT token sent by the user when reissuing a new token
    (POST request to `/token` endpoint). Therefore it allows modifying
    payload within the token and also reissuing new token which will be
    signed by the system and become valid. This weakness provides an
    opportunity to forge the user\'s identity by changing the information
    inside the token\'s payload that is used to authenticate the client
