  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: Versions of `samlify` prior to 2.4.0 are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. The package fails to prevent XML Signature Wrapping, allowing tokens to
    be reused with different usernames. A remote attacker can modify SAML content
    for a SAML service provider without invalidating the cryptographic signature,
    which may allow attackers to bypass primary authentication for the affected SAML
    service provider.

  title: XML Injection
  description: |
    [`samlify`][1] is a Node.js API for Single Sign On (SAML 2.0).

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to XML Injection
    attack.

    An XML Signature Wrapping vulnerability exists in Samlify 2.2.0 and
    earlier, and in predecessor Express-saml2 which could allow attackers to
    impersonate arbitrary users.

  title: Improper Verification of Signature
  description: |
    [samlify][1] is a Highly configuarable Node.js SAML 2.0 library for
    Single Sign On.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Verification of Signature. An attacker could potentially wrap the
    signature of a SAML response, and insert a new username in the original
    token, making it appear as though a different user was authenticated.
