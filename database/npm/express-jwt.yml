  title: Authorization Bypass
  description: |
    [express-jwt][1] is a JWT authentication middleware.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authorization
    Bypass. The `algorithms` entry to be specified in the configuration is
    not being enforced. When `algorithms` is not specified in the
    configuration, with the combination of `jwks-rsa`, it may lead to
    authorization bypass.
