  description: Versions of `realms-shim` prior to 1.2.1 are vulnerable to a Sandbox
    Breakout. The Realms evaluation function has an option to apply Babel-like transformations
    to the source code before it reaches the evaluator. One portion of this transform
    pipeline exposed a primal-Realm object to the rewriting function. Confined code
    which used the evaluator itself could provide a malicious rewriter function that
    captured this object, and use it to breach the sandbox.

  title: Sandbox Breakout
  description: |
    [realms-shim][1] is a shim implementation of the Realm API Proposal.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Sandbox Breakout.
    The realms-shim is intended to provide a \"safe evaluator\" which
    executes arbitrary strings code with limited authority. This provides a
    \"sandbox\" which only has access to the specific objects and power that
    the caller chooses to expose. The `evaluate()` function it implements
    takes two additional arguments: `endowments` (which are exposed in the
    global lexical scope), and an options bag. The `transforms` option is a
    list of functions that are applied to the string of code, to apply
    Babel-like transformations before it gets executed (e.g. to implement
    syntax extensions).

    A bug was found in the transformation pipeline that exposed a
    primal-Realm object to one of the transform functions. The confined code
    could use this to escape the sandbox and compromise the Realm which
    created it. This generally leads to a full compromise of the
    application.
