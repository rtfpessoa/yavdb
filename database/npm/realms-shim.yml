  description: Versions of `realms-shim` prior to 1.2.0 are vulnerable to a Sandbox
    Breakout. The package's core evaluator, which must switch between "unsafe mode"
    and "safe mode" for each call, could be left in "unsafe mode" if an attacker is
    able to force a RangeError in a specific timeframe. This would allow the attacker
    to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code.

  description: Versions of `realms-shim` prior to 1.2.0 are vulnerable to a Sandbox
    Breakout. The package's confined evaluator depended upon correct behavior of the
    spread operator `a = [...b, ...c]`, which could be modified by the confined code.
    This may allow an attacker to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code.

    to reach the prototypes of the primal Realm, which may allow an attacker to escape
    the sandbox and execute arbitrary code.
