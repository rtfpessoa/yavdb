  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service
  description: |-
    `npm-user-validate` before version `1.0.1` is vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (REDos). The regex that validates user emails took exponentially longer to process long input strings beginning with `@` characters.

    #### Impact
    The issue affects the `email` function. If you use this function to process arbitrary user input with no character limit the application may be susceptible to Denial of Service.

    #### Patches
    The issue is patched in version 1.0.1 by improving the regular expression used and also enforcing a 254 character limit.

    #### Workarounds
    Restrict the character length to a reasonable degree before passing a value to `.email()`; Also, consider doing a more rigorous sanitizing/validation beforehand.
