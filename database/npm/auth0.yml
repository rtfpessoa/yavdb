    Versions of `auth0`  before `2.27.1` use a block list of specific keys that should be sanitized from the request object contained in the error object.  When a request to Auth0 management API fails, the key for `Authorization` header is not sanitized and the `Authorization` header value can be logged exposing a bearer token.

    You are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply:

    - You are using `auth0` npm package
    - You are using a Machine to Machine application authorized to use Auth0's management API https://auth0.com/docs/flows/concepts/client-credentials
