  title: Malicious Package
  description: |-
    All versions of `http-proxy-middelware` contain malicious code. The `index.js` file attempts to download a file from a remote server and execute it. The file is not run upon installation - the package needs to be required or the `index.js` run manually.

    The package contains a typo in its code which lead to it not functioning properly. Additionally, the remote file it attempted to download is currently not retrievable anymore but might have been in the past and its contents are unknown.
