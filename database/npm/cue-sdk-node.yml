  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol
  description: |
    [`cue-sdk-node`][1] is a Corsair Cue SDK wrapper for node.js.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man in the Middle
    (MitM) attacks due to downloading resources over an insecure protocol.
    The vulnerability is in the `/getdll.js` file, where it downloads a zip
    file over http. Without a secure connection, it is possible for an
    attacker to intercept this connection and alter the packages received.
    In serious cases, this may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on
    your host server.
