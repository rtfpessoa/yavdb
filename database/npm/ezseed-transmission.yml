  title: Insecure Defaults Leads to Potential MITM
  description: |
    Affected versions of `ezseed-transmission` download and run a script over an HTTP connection.

    An attacker in a privileged network position could launch a Man-in-the-Middle attack and intercept the script, replacing it with malicious code, completely compromising the system running `ezseed-transmission`.

  title: Insecure Defaults Allow MitM
  description: |
    [`ezseed-transmission`][1] is a module that provides shell bindings for
    Ezseed transmission.

    Between versions 0.0.10 and 0.0.14 (inclusive), ezseed-transmission
    would download a script from
    `http://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/linux64/jq` without checking the
    certificate. An attacker on the same network or on an ISP level could
    intercept the traffic and push their own version of the file, causing
    the attackers code to be executed.
