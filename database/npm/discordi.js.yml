  title: Malicious Package
  description: |
    `discordi.js` is a malicious package that uses [typosquatting][1] to
    bait unknowing users to install them. Packages like this, which carry
    similar names to an original package, offer all the functionality of
    their original, but they also include a code snippet that sends your
    login tokens to pastebin.
