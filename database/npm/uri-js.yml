  title: Regular Expression Denial Of Service
  description: "> uri-js is a module that tries to fully implement RFC 3986. One of
    these features is validating whether or not a supplied URL is valid or not. To
    do this, uri-js uses a regular expression, This regular expression is vulnerable
    to redos. This causes the program to hang and the CPU to idle at 100% usage while
    uri-js is trying to validate if the supplied URL is valid or not. To check if
    you're vulnerable, look for a call to require(\"uri-js\").parse() where a user
    is able to send their own input.\n> \n> -- [nodesecurity.io](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/100)"
