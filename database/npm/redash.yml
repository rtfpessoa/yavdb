  title: Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  description: |
    [redash][1] is an A better Standard Library for JavaScript

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-side Request
    Forgery (SSRF) via the `JSON` data source. Possibly, other connectors
    are affected. The SSRF is potent and provides a lot of flexibility in
    terms of being able to craft HTTP requests e.g., by adding headers,
    selecting any HTTP verb, etc.
