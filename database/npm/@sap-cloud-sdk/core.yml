  title: Improper Authorization
  description: Affected versions of `@sap-cloud-sdk/core` do not properly validate
    JWTs.  The `verifyJwt()` function does not properly validate the URL from where
    the public verification key for the JWT can be downloaded.  Any URL was trusted
    which makes it possible to provide a URL belonging to a manipulated JWT.
