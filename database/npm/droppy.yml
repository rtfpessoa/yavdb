  title: No CSRF Validation
  description: Affected versions of `droppy`  are vulnerable to cross-site socket
    forgery. The package does not perform verification for cross-domain websocket
    requests, and as a result, an attacker can create a web page that opens up a websocket
    connection on behalf of the user visiting the page. The attacker can then perform
    any action that the target user could, including adding a new admin account under
    their control, or deleting others.

  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |+
    `droopy` prior to 3.5.0 lacks cross-domain websocket requests
    verification. This allows attackers to send malicious requests while
    inheriting the identity and privileges of the currently logged in user.

    \nCross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user
    to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they\'re
    currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing
    requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has no way to see the
    response to the forged request. With a little help of social engineering
    (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the
    users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker\'s
    choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can
    force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring
    funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an
    administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.
