    network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the executable

  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol
  description: |
    [`haxe`][1]

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man in the Middle
    (MitM) attacks due to downloading resources over an insecure protocol.
    Without a secure connection, it is possible for an attacker to intercept
    this connection and alter the packages received. In serious cases, this
    may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host server.
