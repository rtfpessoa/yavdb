  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [flintcms][1] is a CMS built to be easy to use and super flexible.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege Escalation
    due to lack of user input sanitization in the route that verifies the
    password reset token. The value from the parameter is directly sent to
    the Mongoose API which allows a user to insert MongoDB query operators.
    These operators can be used to extract the value of the field blindly in
    the same manner of a blind SQL injection.
