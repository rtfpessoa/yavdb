  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [limdu][1] is an A machine learning framework for Node.js. Supports
    multi-level classification and online learning.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection
    via the `trainBatch` function. Clients of the Limdu library are unlikely
    to be aware of this, so they might unwittingly write code that contains
    a vulnerability.
