  title: Malicious Package
  description: |
    [vue-backbone][1] is a Vue.js Plugin to facilitate gradual migration
    from Backbone. Backbone Collections and Models can be safely integrated
    with Vue instances and components, with focus on clean code and future
    adoption of a Flux library (e.g. Vuex/Redux/Flux).

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Malicious Package.
    The package contains malicious code that when executed in the browser
    enumerates password, cvc and cardnumber fields from forms and sends the
    extracted values to `https://js-metrics.com/minjs.php?pl=`
