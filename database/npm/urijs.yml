  title: Hostname spoofing via backslashes in URL
  description: "URI.js is a javascript URL mutation library (npm package urijs).\n\nIn
    URI.js before version 1.19.4, the hostname can be spoofed by using a backslash
    (`\\`) character followed by an at (`@`) character. If the hostname is used in
    security decisions, the decision may be incorrect. Depending on library usage
    and attacker intent, impacts may include allow/block list bypasses, SSRF attacks,
    open redirects, or other undesired behavior.\n\nFor example the URL `https://expected-example.com\\@observed-example.com`
    will incorrectly return `observed-example.com` if using an affected version. Patched
    versions correctly return `expected-example.com`. Patched versions match the behavior
    of other parsers which implement the WHATWG URL specification, including web browsers
    and Node's built-in URL class. Version 1.19.4 is patched against all known payload
    variants. \n\nVersion 1.19.3 has a partial patch but is still vulnerable to a
    payload variant."
