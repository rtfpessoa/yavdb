  title: Improper Authentication
  description: |
    [eth-ledger-bridge-keyring][1] is an implementation of MetaMask\'s
    Keyring interface, that uses a Ledger hardware wallet for all
    cryptographic operations.

    **Note:** This package has been deprecated and replaced by
    `@metamask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring`

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authentication. It affects users who are using this library to sign with
    a `BIP44` account other than the first account. If a user is signing
    with the first account (i.e. the account at index 0), or with the legacy
    `MEW/MyCrypto` HD path, they are not affected.
