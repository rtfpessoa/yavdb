  title: Incorrect Account Used for Signing
  description: "Versions of `eth-ledger-bridge-keyring` prior to 0.2.1 may use incorrect
    accounts for signing transactions.  \n\nThe vulnerability impacts cases where
    the user signs a personal message or transaction without first adding the account.
    This includes cases where the user has already added the account in a previous
    session (i.e. they added the account, reset the application, then signed something).
    The serialization/deserialization process does restore a previously added account,
    but it doesn't restore the index instructing the keyring to use that account for
    signing. As a result, after serializing then deserializing the keyring state,
    the account at index 0 is always used for signing even if it isn't the current
    account.  \n\nAny usage of this package to sign with a BIP44 account other than
    the first account may be vulnerable. If a user is signing with the first account
    (i.e. the account at index 0), or with the legacy MEW/MyCrypto HD path, they are
    not affected."

  title: Improper Authentication
  description: |
    [eth-ledger-bridge-keyring][1] is an implementation of MetaMask\'s
    Keyring interface, that uses a Ledger hardware wallet for all
    cryptographic operations.

    **Note:** This package has been deprecated and replaced by
    `@metamask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring`

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authentication. It affects users who are using this library to sign with
    a `BIP44` account other than the first account. If a user is signing
    with the first account (i.e. the account at index 0), or with the legacy
    `MEW/MyCrypto` HD path, they are not affected.
