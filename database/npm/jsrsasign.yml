  title: Timing Attack
  description: Versions of `jsrsasign` are vulnerable to Timing Attacks. The `signHex`
    function uses a timing-unsafe method for ECDSA key generation and signing. This
    leaks the length of the scalar, which attackers may use to brute-force the private
    key. Timing attacks can be used to increase the efficiency of brute-force attacks
    by removing the exponential increase in entropy gained from longer secrets. This
    issue only affects the ECDSA functions.

  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [jsrsasign][1] is a free pure JavaScript cryptographic library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attack.
    Practical recovery of the long-term private key generated by the library
    is possible under certain conditions. Leakage of a bit-length of the
    scalar during scalar multiplication is possible on an elliptic curve
    which might allow practical recovery of the long-term private key.
