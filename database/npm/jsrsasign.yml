  title: Timing Attack
  description: Versions of `jsrsasign` are vulnerable to Timing Attacks. The `signHex`
    function uses a timing-unsafe method for ECDSA key generation and signing. This
    leaks the length of the scalar, which attackers may use to brute-force the private
    key. Timing attacks can be used to increase the efficiency of brute-force attacks
    by removing the exponential increase in entropy gained from longer secrets. This
    issue only affects the ECDSA functions.

  title: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature
  description: Versions of `jsrsasign`prior to 8.0.17 fail to properly verify cryptographic
    signatures. Its RSASSA-PSS (RSA-PSS) implementation does not detect signature
    manipulation/modification by prepending '\0' bytes to a signature (it accepts
    these modified signatures as valid). An attacker can abuse this behavior in an
    application by creating multiple valid signatures where only one signature should
    exist. Also, an attacker might prepend these bytes with the goal of triggering
    memory corruption issues.

  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [jsrsasign][1] is a free pure JavaScript cryptographic library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attack.
    Practical recovery of the long-term private key generated by the library
    is possible under certain conditions. Leakage of a bit-length of the
    scalar during scalar multiplication is possible on an elliptic curve
    which might allow practical recovery of the long-term private key.

  title: Signature Bypass
  description: |
    [jsrsasign][1] is a free pure JavaScript cryptographic library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Signature Bypass. It
    allows a malleability in ECDSA signatures by not checking overflows in
    the length of a sequence and \'0\' characters appended or prepended to
    an integer. The modified signatures are verified as valid. This could
    have a security-relevant impact if an application relied on a single
    canonical signature.

  title: Memory Corruption
  description: |
    [jsrsasign][1] is a free pure JavaScript cryptographic library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Memory Corruption.
    Its RSA PKCS1 v1.5 decryption implementation does not detect ciphertext
    modification by prepending \'\\0\' bytes to ciphertexts (it decrypts
    modified ciphertexts without error). An attacker might prepend these
    bytes with the goal of triggering memory corruption issues.
