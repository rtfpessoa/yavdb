  title: Command Injection
  description: All versions of `traceroute` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The
    package fails to sanitize input and passes it directly to an `exec` call, which
    may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system. The `trace` function
    is vulnerable and can be abused if the `host` value is controlled by an attacker.

  title: Shell Command Injection
  description: "[`traceroute`][1] is an npm package used for listing references in
    a\nremote git repository.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable
    to Arbitrary Command\nInjection due to the insecure use of `exec`. An attacker
    can add a\nnewline `%0a` after the host addr, and inject malicious shell commands\nto
    disrupt server operation or obtain sensitive information.\n\n### PoC by Dor Dali
