  title: Timing Attack
  description: Versions of `express-basic-auth` prior to 1.2.0 are vulnerable to Timing
    Attacks. The package uses nating string comparison instead of a constant time
    string compare which may lead to Timing Attacks. Timing Attacks can be used to
    increase the efficiency of brute-force attacks by removing the exponential increase
    in entropy gained from longer secrets.

  description: |
    [express-basic-auth][1] is a simple plug &amp; play HTTP basic auth
    middleware for Express.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attack due to
    it using native string compare for passwords, as oppose to comparing
    with a set constant time.
