  title: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
  description: |
    [parse][1] is a library that gives you access to the powerful Parse
    Server backend from your JavaScript app.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. The `setPassword` method
    ([http://parseplatform.org/Parse-SDK-JS/api/2.9.1/Parse.User.html#setPassword][2])
    stores the user\'s password in localStorage as raw text making it
    vulnerable to anyone with access to your localStorage. We believe this
    is the only time that password is stored at all. In the documentation
    under Users &gt; Signing Up, it clearly states, \"We never store
    passwords in plaintext, nor will we ever transmit passwords back to the
    client in plaintext.\"

    ### PoC by Diamond Lewis and Colin Ulin   {#poc-by-diamond-lewis-and-colin-ulin}

        async () => {
            const user = Parse.User.current()
            if (user) {
                user.setPassword('newpass')
                await user.save()
            }
        }

    After running the above code, the new password will be stored in
    localStorage as a property named \"password\".
