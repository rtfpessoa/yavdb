  title: Command Injection
  description: |-
    Versions of `open` before 6.0.0 are vulnerable to command injection when unsanitized user input is passed in.

    The package does come with the following warning in the readme:

    ```
    The same care should be taken when calling open as if you were calling child_process.exec directly. If it is an executable it will run in a new shell.
    ```

  title: Arbitrary Code Injection
  description: |
    [open][1] is a cross platform package that opens stuff like URLs, files,
    executables.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Injection when unsanitized user input is passed in.

    The package does come with the following warning in the readme:

        The same care should be taken when calling open as if you were calling child_process.exec directly. If it is an executable it will run in a new shell.

    The package `open` is replacing the `opn` package, which is now
    deprecated. The older versions of `open` are vulnerable.

    **Note: Upgrading `open` to the last version will prevent this
    vulnerability but is also likely to have unwanted effects since it now
    has a very different API.**

  title: Arbitrary Command Injection
  description: |
    [open][1] is a cross platform package that opens stuff like URLs, files,
    executables.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command
    Injection. Urls are not properly escaped before concatenating them into
    the command that is opened using `exec()`.

    **Note: Upgrading `open` to the last version will prevent this
    vulnerability but is also likely to have unwanted effects since it now
    has a very different API.**
