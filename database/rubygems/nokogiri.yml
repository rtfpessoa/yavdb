  title: Nokogiri gem contains several vulnerabilities in libxml2 and libxslt
  description: |
    Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the libxml2 and libxslt libraries
    that the Nokogiri gem depends on.

    CVE-2015-1819
    A denial of service flaw was found in the way libxml2 parsed XML
    documents. This flaw could cause an application that uses libxml2 to use an
    excessive amount of memory.

    CVE-2015-7941
    libxml2 does not properly stop parsing invalid input, which allows
    context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read
    and libxml2 crash) via crafted specially XML data.

    CVE-2015-7942
    The xmlParseConditionalSections function in parser.c in libxml2
    does not properly skip intermediary entities when it stops parsing invalid
    input, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
    (out-of-bounds read and crash) via crafted XML data.

    CVE-2015-7995
    The xsltStylePreCompute function in preproc.c in libxslt 1.1.28 does not
    check whether the parent node is an element, which allows attackers to cause
    a denial of service using a specially crafted XML document.

    CVE-2015-8035
    The xz_decomp function in xzlib.c in libxml2 2.9.1 does not
    properly detect compression errors, which allows context-dependent attackers
    to cause a denial of service (process hang) via crafted XML data.

    Another vulnerability was discoverd in libxml2 that could cause parsing
    of unclosed comments to result in "conditional jump or move depends on
    uninitialized value(s)" and unsafe memory access. This issue does not have a
    CVE assigned yet. See related URLs for details. Patched in v1.6.7.rc4.

  title: Nokogiri gem contains several vulnerabilities in libxml2
  description: |
    Nokogiri version 1.6.7.1 has been released, pulling in several upstream
    patches to the vendored libxml2 to address the following CVEs:

    CVE-2015-5312
    CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.1 (HIGH)
    The xmlStringLenDecodeEntities function in parser.c in libxml2
    before 2.9.3 does not properly prevent entity expansion, which
    allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
    service (CPU consumption) via crafted XML data, a different
    vulnerability than CVE-2014-3660.

    CVE-2015-7497
    CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (MEDIUM)
    Heap-based buffer overflow in the xmlDictComputeFastQKey
    function in dict.c in libxml2 before 2.9.3 allows
    context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service via
    unspecified vectors.

    CVE-2015-7498
    CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (MEDIUM)
    Heap-based buffer overflow in the xmlParseXmlDecl function in
    parser.c in libxml2 before 2.9.3 allows context-dependent
    attackers to cause a denial of service via unspecified vectors
    related to extracting errors after an encoding conversion
    failure.

    CVE-2015-7499
    CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (MEDIUM)
    Heap-based buffer overflow in the xmlGROW function in parser.c
    in libxml2 before 2.9.3 allows context-dependent attackers to
    obtain sensitive process memory information via unspecified
    vectors.

    CVE-2015-7500
    CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (MEDIUM)
    The xmlParseMisc function in parser.c in libxml2 before 2.9.3
    allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
    service (out-of-bounds heap read) via unspecified vectors
    related to incorrect entities boundaries and start tags.

    CVE-2015-8241
    CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.4 (MEDIUM)
    The xmlNextChar function in libxml2 2.9.2 does not properly
    check the state, which allows context-dependent attackers to
    cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and
    application crash) or obtain sensitive information via crafted
    XML data.

    CVE-2015-8242
    CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.8 (MEDIUM)
    The xmlSAX2TextNode function in SAX2.c in the push interface in
    the HTML parser in libxml2 before 2.9.3 allows
    context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
    service (stack-based buffer over-read and application crash) or
    obtain sensitive information via crafted XML data.

    CVE-2015-8317
    CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (MEDIUM)
    The xmlParseXMLDecl function in parser.c in libxml2 before
    2.9.3 allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive
    information via an (1) unterminated encoding value or (2)
    incomplete XML declaration in XML data, which triggers an
    out-of-bounds heap read.

    libxml2 could be made to crash if it opened a specially crafted
    file. It was discovered that libxml2 incorrectly handled certain
    malformed documents. If a user or automated system were tricked
    into opening a specially crafted document, an attacker could
    possibly cause libxml2 to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

    The version of libxml2 packaged with Nokogiri contains several
    vulnerabilities. Nokogiri has mitigated these issues by upgrading to
    libxml 2.9.5.

    It was discovered that a type confusion error existed in libxml2. An
    attacker could use this to specially construct XML data that
    could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary
    code. (CVE-2017-0663)

    It was discovered that libxml2 did not properly validate parsed entity
    references. An attacker could use this to specially construct XML
    data that could expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-7375)

    It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in libxml2 when
    handling HTTP redirects. An attacker could use this to specially
    construct XML data that could cause a denial of service or possibly
    execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7376)

    Marcel Böhme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered a buffer overflow in
    libxml2 when handling elements. An attacker could use this to specially
    construct XML data that could cause a denial of service or possibly
    execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-9047)

    Marcel Böhme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered a buffer overread
    in libxml2 when handling elements. An attacker could use this
    to specially construct XML data that could cause a denial of
    service. (CVE-2017-9048)

    Marcel Böhme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered multiple buffer overreads
    in libxml2 when handling parameter-entity references. An attacker
    could use these to specially construct XML data that could cause a

    Nokogiri 1.8.5 has been released.

    This is a security and bugfix release. It addresses two CVEs in upstream
    libxml2 rated as "medium" by Red Hat, for which details are below.

    If you're using your distro's system libraries, rather than Nokogiri's
    vendored libraries, there's no security need to upgrade at this time,
    though you may want to check with your distro whether they've patched this
    (Canonical has patched Ubuntu packages). Note that these patches are not
    yet (as of 2018-10-04) in an upstream release of libxml2.

    Full details about the security update are available in Github Issue #1785.
    [#1785]: https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1785

    CVE-2019-11068

    Permalinks are:
    - Canonical: https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11068
    - Debian: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11068

    Description:

    > libxslt through 1.1.33 allows bypass of a protection mechanism
    > because callers of xsltCheckRead and xsltCheckWrite permit access
    > even upon receiving a -1 error code. xsltCheckRead can return -1 for
    > a crafted URL that is not actually invalid and is subsequently
    > loaded.

    Canonical rates this as "Priority: Medium".

    Debian rates this as "NVD Severity: High (attack range: remote)".

  title: Nokogiri gem, via libxslt, is affected by multiple vulnerabilities
  description: |
    Nokogiri v1.10.5 has been released.

    This is a security release. It addresses three CVEs in upstream libxml2,
    for which details are below.

    If you're using your distro's system libraries, rather than Nokogiri's
    vendored libraries, there's no security need to upgrade at this time,
    though you may want to check with your distro whether they've patched this
    (Canonical has patched Ubuntu packages). Note that libxslt 1.1.34 addresses
    these vulnerabilities.

    Full details about the security update are available in Github Issue
    [#1943] https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1943.

    CVE-2019-13117

    https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2019/CVE-2019-13117.html

    Priority: Low

    Description: In numbers.c in libxslt 1.1.33, an xsl:number with certain format strings
    could lead to a uninitialized read in xsltNumberFormatInsertNumbers. This
    could allow an attacker to discern whether a byte on the stack contains the
    characters A, a, I, i, or 0, or any other character.

    Priority: Low

    Description: In numbers.c in libxslt 1.1.33, a type holding grouping characters of an
    xsl:number instruction was too narrow and an invalid character/length
    combination could be passed to xsltNumberFormatDecimal, leading to a read
    of uninitialized stack data

    Description: In xsltCopyText in transform.c in libxslt 1.1.33, a pointer variable isn't
    reset under certain circumstances. If the relevant memory area happened to
    be freed and reused in a certain way, a bounds check could fail and memory

  title: Nokogiri Command Injection Vulnerability via Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file
  description: |
    A command injection vulnerability in Nokogiri v1.10.3 and earlier allows
    commands to be executed in a subprocess by Ruby's `Kernel.open` method.
    Processes are vulnerable only if the undocumented method
    `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file` is being passed untrusted user input.

    This vulnerability appears in code generated by the Rexical gem versions
    v1.0.6 and earlier. Rexical is used by Nokogiri to generate lexical scanner
    code for parsing CSS queries. The underlying vulnerability was addressed in
    Rexical v1.0.7 and Nokogiri upgraded to this version of Rexical in
    Nokogiri v1.10.4.

    Upgrade to Nokogiri v1.10.4, or avoid calling the undocumented method
    `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file` with untrusted user input.

    [1]: https://rubygems.org/gems/nokogiri
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [nokogiri][1] is an HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parser, with the ability
    to search documents via XPath or CSS3 selectors.

    Affected versions of this Gem are vulnerable to both Memory Exhaustion
    and [Sensitive Information Exposure][2]. Heap-based buffer overflow in
    the `xmlGROW` function in parser.c in libxml2 allows context-dependent
    attackers to obtain sensitive process memory information via unspecified
    vectors. libxml2 could be made to crash if it opened a specially crafted
    file. It was discovered that libxml2 incorrectly handled certain
    malformed documents. If a user or automated system were tricked into
    opening a specially crafted document, an attacker could possibly cause
    libxml2 to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that

  title: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
  description: |+
    [nokogiri][1] is an HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parser, with the ability
    to search documents via XPath or CSS3 selectors.

    Affected versions of this Gem are vulnerable to XML External Entity
    (XXE) attacks. `Nokogiri` is affected by series of vulnerabilities in
    libxml2 and libxslt, which are libraries it depends on. When handling
    the expansion of XML external entities (XXE) in libxml2, you can specify
    documents to be read. This can be used by attackers to load specially
    crafted XML documents on an internal XML parsing service and may lead to
    unauthorized disclosure of potentially sensitive information.

    **Note:** This vulnerability exists also in versions `>=1.5.4 <1.8.3`
    only when opting into the `DTDLOAD` option and opting out of the `NONET`
    option. See information [here][2]



    [1]: https://rubygems.org/gems/nokogiri
    [2]: https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-NOKOGIRI-20299
    \nXXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML
    input. XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding
    documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
    By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external
    entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing.
    When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and
    include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.

    Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive
    data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or
    relative paths in the system identifier.

    For example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element-
    username.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
           <username>John</username>
        </xml>
    {: .language-xml}

    An external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and
    present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or
    remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML
    entity that would fetch the content of `/etc/passwd` and display it to
    the user rendered by `username`.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
        <!DOCTYPE foo [
           <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
           <username>&xxe;</username>
        </xml>
    {: .language-xml}

    Other XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop
    returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading
    to Denial of Service.

  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [nokogiri][1] is a gem for parsing HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection
    via the undocumented method `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file`. This
    allows commands to be executed in a subprocess.

  title: Uncontrolled Memory Allocation
  description: |
    [nokogiri][1] is a gem for parsing HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Uncontrolled Memory
    Allocation. Nokogiri bundles the `libxslt` C library, that has been
    recently discovered to have vulnerabilities.

    CVE-2019-13117 In `numbers.c` in `libxslt` 1.1.33, an `xsl:number` with
    certain format strings could lead to a uninitialized read in
    `xsltNumberFormatInsertNumbers`. This could allow an attacker to discern
    whether a byte on the stack contains the characters `A`, `a`, `I`, `i`,
    or `0`, or any other character.

    CVE-2019-13118 In `numbers.c` in `libxslt` 1.1.33, a type holding
    grouping characters of an `xsl:number` instruction was too narrow and an
    invalid character/length combination could be passed to
    `xsltNumberFormatDecimal`, leading to a read of uninitialized stack data

    CVE-2019-18197 In `xsltCopyTex`t in `transform.c` in `libxslt` 1.1.33, a
    pointer variable isn\'t reset under certain circumstances. If the
    relevant memory area happened to be freed and reused in a certain way, a
    bounds check could fail and memory outside a buffer could be written to,
    or uninitialized data could be disclosed.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |
    [nokogiri][1] is an HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parser. Among Nokogiri\'s
    features is the ability to search documents via XPath or CSS3 selectors.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to several Denial of
    Service (DoS) vulnerabilities. Nokogiri bundles the `libxml2` library,
    which is vulnerable in versions through 2.9.6.

    ### CVE-2018-14404   {#cve-2018-14404}

    A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the
    `xpath.c:xmlXPathCompOpEval()` function of libxml2 through 2.9.8 when
    parsing an invalid XPath expression in the `XPATH_OP_AND` or
    `XPATH_OP_OR` case. Applications processing untrusted XSL format inputs
    with the use of the libxml2 library may be vulnerable to a denial of
    service attack due to a crash of the application

    ### CVE-2018-14567   {#cve-2018-14567}

    If `--with-lzma` is used, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service (infinite loop) via a crafted XML file that triggers
    `LZMA_MEMLIMIT_ERROR`, as demonstrated by xmllint infinite loop in LZMA
    decompression.
