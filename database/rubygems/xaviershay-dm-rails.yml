    table

  description: |
    xaviershay-dm-rails Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the execute() function
    in /datamapper/dm-rails/blob/master/lib/dm-rails/storage.rb. The issue is
    due to the function exposing sensitive information via the process table.
    This may allow a local attack to gain access to MySQL credential information.

    `xaviershay-dm-rails` allows datamapper to hook into rails3.

    Affected versions call `mysql` while exposing the DB connection password
    on the command line, making it available via the process table. An
    attacker with access to the server running this application is capable
    of intercepting the password with `while (true) do ps -ef | grep
    [p]assword; done`.
