  title: Possible Information Leak Vulnerability in Action View
  description: |
    There is a possible directory traversal and information leak vulnerability in
    Action View. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
    CVE-2016-0752.

    Versions Affected:  All.
    Not affected:       None.
    Fixed Versions:     5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1, 3.2.22.1

    Impact
    ------
    Applications that pass unverified user input to the `render` method in a
    controller may be vulnerable to an information leak vulnerability.

    Impacted code will look something like this:

    ```ruby
    def index
      render params[:id]
    end
    ```

    Carefully crafted requests can cause the above code to render files from
    unexpected places like outside the application's view directory, and can
    possibly escalate this to a remote code execution attack.

    All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
    workarounds immediately.

    Releases
    --------
    The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.

    Workarounds
    -----------
    A workaround to this issue is to not pass arbitrary user input to the `render`
    method.  Instead, verify that data before passing it to the `render` method.

    For example, change this:

    ```ruby
    def index
      render params[:id]
    end
    ```

    To this:

    ```ruby
    def index
      render verify_template(params[:id])
    end

    private
    def verify_template(name)
      # add verification logic particular to your application here
    end
    ```

    Patches
    -------
    To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for
    the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a
    single changeset.

    * 3-2-render_data_leak.patch - Patch for 3.2 series
    * 4-1-render_data_leak.patch - Patch for 4.1 series
    * 4-2-render_data_leak.patch - Patch for 4.2 series
    * 5-0-render_data_leak.patch - Patch for 5.0 series

    Please note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users
    of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we
    cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported
    releases.

  title: Possible XSS Vulnerability in Action View
  description: |
    There is a possible XSS vulnerability in Action View.  Text declared as "HTML
    safe" will not have quotes escaped when used as attribute values in tag
    helpers.

    Impact
    ------

    Text declared as "HTML safe" when passed as an attribute value to a tag helper
    will not have quotes escaped which can lead to an XSS attack.  Impacted code
    looks something like this:

    ```ruby
    content_tag(:div, "hi", title: user_input.html_safe)
    ```

    Some helpers like the `sanitize` helper will automatically mark strings as
    "HTML safe", so impacted code could also look something like this:

    ```ruby
    content_tag(:div, "hi", title: sanitize(user_input))
    ```

    All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
    workarounds immediately.

    Workarounds
    -----------
    You can work around this issue by either *not* marking arbitrary user input as
    safe, or by manually escaping quotes like this:

    ```ruby
    def escape_quotes(value)
      value.gsub(/"/, '&quot;'.freeze)
    end

    content_tag(:div, "hi", title: escape_quotes(sanitize(user_input)))

  title: File Content Disclosure in Action View
  description: |
    There is a possible file content disclosure vulnerability in Action View. This
    vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2019-5418.

    Versions Affected:  All.
    Not affected:       None.
    Fixed Versions:     6.0.0.beta3, 5.2.2.1, 5.1.6.2, 5.0.7.2, 4.2.11.1

    Impact
    ------
    There is a possible file content disclosure vulnerability in Action View.
    Specially crafted accept headers in combination with calls to `render file:`
    can cause arbitrary files on the target server to be rendered, disclosing the
    file contents.

    The impact is limited to calls to `render` which render file contents without
    a specified accept format.  Impacted code in a controller looks something like
    this:

    ```
    class UserController < ApplicationController
      def index
        render file: "#{Rails.root}/some/file"
      end
    end
    ```

    Rendering templates as opposed to files is not impacted by this vulnerability.

    All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
    workarounds immediately.

    Releases
    --------
    The 6.0.0.beta3, 5.2.2.1, 5.1.6.2, 5.0.7.2, and 4.2.11.1 releases are
    available at the normal locations.

    Workarounds
    -----------
    This vulnerability can be mitigated by specifying a format for file rendering,
    like this:

    ```
    class UserController < ApplicationController
      def index
        render file: "#{Rails.root}/some/file", formats: [:html]
      end
    end
    ```

    In summary, impacted calls to `render` look like this:

    ```
    render file: "#{Rails.root}/some/file"
    ```

    The vulnerability can be mitigated by changing to this:

    ```
    render file: "#{Rails.root}/some/file", formats: [:html]
    ```

    Other calls to `render` are not impacted.

    Alternatively, the following monkey patch can be applied in an initializer:

    ```
    $ cat config/initializers/formats_filter.rb
    # frozen_string_literal: true

    ActionDispatch::Request.prepend(Module.new do
      def formats
        super().select do |format|
          format.symbol || format.ref == "*/*"
        end
      end
    end)
    ```

  title: Possible XSS vulnerability in ActionView
  description: |
    There is a possible XSS vulnerability in ActionView's JavaScript literal
    escape helpers.  Views that use the `j` or `escape_javascript` methods
    may be susceptible to XSS attacks.

    Versions Affected:  All.
    Not affected:       None.
    Fixed Versions:     6.0.2.2, 5.2.4.2

    Impact
    ------
    There is a possible XSS vulnerability in the `j` and `escape_javascript`
    methods in ActionView.  These methods are used for escaping JavaScript string
    literals.  Impacted code will look something like this:

    ```erb
    <script>let a = `<%= j unknown_input %>`</script>
    ```

    or

    ```erb
    <script>let a = `<%= escape_javascript unknown_input %>`</script>
    ```

    Releases
    --------
    The 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2 releases are available at the normal locations.

    Workarounds
    -----------
    For those that can't upgrade, the following monkey patch may be used:

    ```ruby
    ActionView::Helpers::JavaScriptHelper::JS_ESCAPE_MAP.merge!(
      {
        "`" => "\\`",
        "$" => "\\$"
      }
    )

    module ActionView::Helpers::JavaScriptHelper
      alias :old_ej :escape_javascript
      alias :old_j :j

      def escape_javascript(javascript)
        javascript = javascript.to_s
        if javascript.empty?
          result = ""
        else
          result = javascript.gsub(/(\\|<\/|\r\n|\342\200\250|\342\200\251|[\n\r"']|[`]|[$])/u, JS_ESCAPE_MAP)
        end
        javascript.html_safe? ? result.html_safe : result
      end

      alias :j :escape_javascript
    end

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [actionview][1] is a simple, battle-tested conventions and helpers for
    building web pages.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). Specially crafted accept headers can cause the Action View
    template location code to consume 100% CPU, causing the server to be
    unable to process requests. It impacts all `Rails` applications that
    render views.



    [1]: https://rubygems.org/gems/actionview
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: "[`actionview`][1] is a conventions and helpers gem for building web\npages.\n\nAffected
    versions of this Gem are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting\n(XSS) attacks via
    unescaped quotes when used as attribute values in tag\nhelpers.\n\nText declared
    as \\\"HTML safe\\\" when passed as an attribute value to a\ntag helper will not
    have quotes escaped which can lead to a Cross-site\nScripting (XSS) attack. Impacted
    code looks something like this:\n\n    content_tag(:div, \"hi\", title: user_input.html_safe)\n{:
    .language-ruby}\n\nSome helpers like the `sanitize` helper will automatically
    mark strings\nas \\\"HTML safe\\\", so impacted code could also look something
    like this:\n\n    content_tag(:div, \"hi\", title: sanitize(user_input))\n{: .language-ruby}\n\nAll
    users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one\nof the workarounds
    immediately.\n\nYou can work around this issue by either *not* marking arbitrary
    user\ninput as safe, or by manually escaping quotes like this:\n\n    def escape_quotes(value)\n
    \     value.gsub(/\"/, '&quot;'.freeze)\n    end\n    \n    content_tag(:div,
    \"hi\", title: escape_quotes(sanitize(user_input)))\n{: .language-ruby}\n\n\n\n[1]:
    https://rubygems.org/gems/actionview\n\\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs
    when the attacker tricks a\nlegitimate web-based application or site to accept
    a request as\noriginating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the
    context of the web application; the web\napplication then delivers that data to
    its users along with other\ntrusted dynamic content, without validating it. The
    browser unknowingly\nexecutes malicious script on the client side (through client-side\nlanguages;
    usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that\nare otherwise typically
    blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nֿInjecting malicious code is the
    most prevalent manner by which XSS is\nexploited; for this reason, escaping characters
    in order to prevent this\nmanipulation is the top method for securing code against
    this\nvulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key
    characters, and\nparticularly key characters included in user input, to prevent
    those\ncharacters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example,\nin
    HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in\norder to be
    interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while\nwithin the code itself,
    they are used for HTML tags. If malicious\ncontent is injected into an application
    that escapes special characters\nand that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as
    HTML tags, those\ncharacters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the
    browser\nif they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this\nway
    the attempted attack is diverted.\n\nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal
    cookies (source: OWASP\nHttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have
    been used to\nexpose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services
    and\nfunctionality and deliver malware.\n\n### Types of attacks   {#types-of-attacks}\n\nThere
    are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n| Type | Origin | Description
    |\n|----------\n| **Stored** | Server | The malicious code is inserted in the
    application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time
    a user clicks the link. |\n| **Reflected** | Server | The attacker delivers a
    malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user.
    When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects
    the attack back to the user’s browser. |\n| **DOM-based** | Client | The attacker
    forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself
    delivers the cross-site scripting data. |\n| **Mutated** |  | The attacker injects
    code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while
    parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even
    adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters. |\n\n### Affected environments
    \  {#affected-environments}\n\nThe following environments are susceptible to an
    XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n###
    How to prevent   {#how-to-prevent}\n\nThis section describes the top best practices
    designed to specifically\nprotect your code:\n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP
    request before reflecting it back,\n  ensuring all data is validated, filtered
    or escaped before echoing\n  anything back to the user, such as the values of
    query parameters\n  during searches.\n* Convert special characters such as `?`,
    `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces\n  to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.\n*
    Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n*
    Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP\n  addresses,
    and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source:
    Wikipedia) to\n  disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n*
    Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your\n  code to
    understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n"
