  title: SQL Injection
  description: |
    [administrate][1] is a gem that is inspired by projects like Rails Admin
    and ActiveAdmin, but aims to provide a better user experience for site
    admins, and to be easier for developers to customize.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL Injection. When
    sorting by attributes on a dashboard, the direction parameter was not
    validated before being interpolated into the SQL query. This could
    present a SQL injection if the attacker were able to modify the
    `direction` parameter and bypass ActiveRecord SQL protections. Whilst
    this does have a high-impact, to exploit this you need access to the
    Administrate dashboards, which we would expect to be behind
    authentication.
