  title: GitLab Grit Gem for Ruby contains a flaw
  description: GitLab Grit Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the app/contexts/search_context.rb
    script. The issue is triggered when input passed via the code search box is not
    properly sanitized, which allows strings to be evaluated by the Bourne shell.
    This may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands.

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [gitlab-grit][1] is a Ruby library for extracting information from a git
    repository in an object oriented manner. It is a GitLab fork.

    Affected versions of this gem contain a flaw in the
    `app/contexts/search_context.rb` script. The code search input box is
    not properly sanitized, which allows strings to be evaluated by the
    Bourne shell. This may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
    commands.
