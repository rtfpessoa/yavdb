  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: "[omniauth-rails][1] is a Rails Engine to make it as easy as possible
    to\nadd oauth authentication to a Rails app.\n\nAffected versions of this package
    are vulnerable to Cross-site Request\nForgery (CSRF). An attacker may be allowed
    to be connected to the user\nwithout the user\\'s intent, interaction, or feedback.
    This permits a\nsecondary account to be able to sign into the web application
    as the\nprimary account.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* The package is only vulnerable when
    used as part of the Ruby on Rails\n  framework.\n* It is possible to use the `omniauth-rails_csrf_protection`
    gem to\n  mitigate this attack\n  ## Remediation   {#remediation}\n  \n  There
    is no fixed version for `omniauth-rails`.\n  ## References   {#references}\n\n*
