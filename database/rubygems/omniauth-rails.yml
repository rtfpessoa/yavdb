  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [omniauth-rails][1] is a Rails Engine to make it as easy as possible to
    add oauth authentication to a Rails app.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). An attacker may be allowed to be connected to the user
    without the user\'s intent, interaction, or feedback. This permits a
    secondary account to be able to sign into the web application as the
    primary account.

    **Note:**

    * The package is only vulnerable when used as part of the Ruby on Rails
      framework.
    * It is possible to use the `omniauth-rails_csrf_protection` gem to
      mitigate this attack
