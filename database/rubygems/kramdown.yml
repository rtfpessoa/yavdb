  title: Remote Code Execution
  description: |
    [kramdown][1] is a Yet-another-markdown-parser but fast, pure Ruby,
    using a strict syntax definition and supporting several common
    extensions.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution. The gem processes the template option inside Kramdown
    documents by default, which allows unintended read access (such as
    template=\"/etc/passwd\") or unintended embedded Ruby code execution
    (such as a string that begins with template=\"string://&lt;%= \`).
