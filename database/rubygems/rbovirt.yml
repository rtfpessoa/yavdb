  title: rbovirt Gem for Ruby contains a flaw
  description: |
    rbovirt Gem for Ruby contains a flaw related to certificate validation.
    The issue is due to the program failing to validate SSL certificates. This may
    allow an attacker with access to network traffic (e.g. MiTM, DNS cache
    poisoning) to spoof the SSL server via an arbitrary certificate that appears
    valid. Such an attack would allow for the interception of sensitive traffic,
    and potentially allow for the injection of content into the SSL stream.

  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [`rbovirt`][1] is a Ruby client for oVirt REST API. Affected versions of
    this gem are vulnerable to authentication bypass due to failing to
    validate SSL certificates. This may allow an attacker with access to
    network traffic (e.g. MiTM, DNS cache poisoning) to spoof the SSL server
    via an arbitrary certificate that appears valid. Such an attack would
    allow for the interception of sensitive traffic, and potentially allow
    for the injection of content into the SSL stream.
