  title: Ruby Command Line API Key Disclosure
  description: |
    [`bio-basespace-sdk`][1] is a Ruby based Software Development Kit to be
    used in the development of Apps and scripts for working with Illumina\'s
    BaseSpace cloud-computing solution for next-gen sequencing data
    analysis. Affected versions of this Gem are vulnerable to Command Line
    API Key Disclosure Attacks due to the API client code passing the
    API\_KEY to a curl command. This may allow a local attacker to gain
    access to API key information by monitoring the process table.
