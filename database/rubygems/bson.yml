  title: Potential denial of service in bson rubygem
  description: |
    The Moped::BSON::ObjecId.legal? method in mongodb/bson-ruby before 3.0.4
    as used in rubygem-moped allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (worker
    resource consumption) via a crafted string. NOTE: This issue is due to an incomplete
    fix to CVE-2015-4410.

  title: Data Injection
  description: |
    [`bson`][1] is a full featured BSON specification implementation in
    Ruby.

    Affected versions of this gem allow an attacker to perform a BSON
    Injection. A flaw in the `ObjectId` validation regular expression can
    enable attackers to inject arbitrary information into a given BSON
    object.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [bson][1] is a a fully featured BSON specification implementation in
    Ruby.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). The `Moped::BSON::ObjecId.legal?` method in `mongodb/bson-ruby`
    as used in `rubygem-moped` allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service (worker resource consumption) via a crafted string. NOTE: This
    issue is due to an incomplete fix to CVE-2015-4410.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
