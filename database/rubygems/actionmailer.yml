  title: Action Mailer Gem for Ruby contains a possible DoS Vulnerability
  description: Action Mailer Gem for Ruby contains a format string flaw in the Log
    Subscriber component. The issue is triggered as format string specifiers (e.g.
    %s and %x) are not properly sanitized in user-supplied input when handling email
    addresses. This may allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`actionmailer`][1] is an Email on Rails. A ruby gem that let\'s you
    compose, deliver, receive, and test emails using the familiar
    controller/view pattern.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Serivce
    (DoS). It does not sanitize format string specifiers (e.g. %s and %x) in
    user-supplied input when handling email addresses.



    [1]: https://rubygems.org/gems/actionmailer
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
