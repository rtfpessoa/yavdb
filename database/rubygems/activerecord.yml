  title: "Ruby on Rails Active Record +serialize+ Helper YAML Attribute Handling Remote\nCode
    Execution \n"
  description: |
    Ruby on Rails contains a flaw in the +serialize+ helper in the Active Record.
    The issue is triggered when the system is configured to allow users to
    directly provide values to be serialized and deserialized using YAML.
    With a specially crafted YAML attribute, a remote attacker can deserialize
    arbitrary YAML and execute code associated with it.

  title: Nested attributes rejection proc bypass in Active Record
  description: |
    There is a vulnerability in how the nested attributes feature in Active Record
    handles updates in combination with destroy flags when destroying records is
    disabled. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-7577.

    Versions Affected:  3.1.0 and newer
    Not affected:       3.0.x and older
    Fixed Versions:     5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1, 3.2.22.1

    Impact
    ------
    When using the nested attributes feature in Active Record you can prevent the
    destruction of associated records by passing the `allow_destroy: false` option
    to the `accepts_nested_attributes_for` method. However due to a change in the
    commit [a9b4b5d][1] the `_destroy` flag prevents the `:reject_if` proc from
    being called because it assumes that the record will be destroyed anyway.

    However this isn't true if `:allow_destroy` is false so this leads to changes
    that would have been rejected being applied to the record. Attackers could use
    this do things like set attributes to invalid values and to clear all of the
    attributes amongst other things. The severity will be dependent on how the
    application has used this feature.

    All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of
    the workarounds immediately.

    Releases
    --------
    The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.

    Workarounds
    -----------
    If you can't upgrade, please use the following monkey patch in an initializer
    that is loaded before your application:

    ```
    $ cat config/initializers/nested_attributes_bypass_fix.rb
    module ActiveRecord
      module NestedAttributes
        private

        def reject_new_record?(association_name, attributes)
          will_be_destroyed?(association_name, attributes) || call_reject_if(association_name, attributes)
        end

        def call_reject_if(association_name, attributes)
          return false if will_be_destroyed?(association_name, attributes)

          case callback = self.nested_attributes_options[association_name][:reject_if]
          when Symbol
            method(callback).arity == 0 ? send(callback) : send(callback, attributes)
          when Proc
            callback.call(attributes)
          end
        end

        def will_be_destroyed?(association_name, attributes)
          allow_destroy?(association_name) && has_destroy_flag?(attributes)
        end

        def allow_destroy?(association_name)
          self.nested_attributes_options[association_name][:allow_destroy]
        end
      end
    end
    ```

  title: Unsafe Query Generation Risk in Active Record
  description: |
    There is a vulnerability when Active Record is used in conjunction with JSON
    parameter parsing. This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2012-2660,
    CVE-2012-2694 and CVE-2013-0155.

    Impact
    ------

    Due to the way Active Record interprets parameters in combination with the way
    that JSON parameters are parsed, it is possible for an attacker to issue
    unexpected database queries with "IS NULL" or empty where clauses.  This issue
    does *not* let an attacker insert arbitrary values into an SQL query, however
    they can cause the query to check for NULL or eliminate a WHERE clause when
    most users wouldn't expect it.

    For example, a system has password reset with token functionality:

    ```ruby
        unless params[:token].nil?
          user = User.find_by_token(params[:token])
          user.reset_password!
        end
    ```

    An attacker can craft a request such that `params[:token]` will return
    `[nil]`.  The `[nil]` value will bypass the test for nil, but will still add
    an "IN ('xyz', NULL)" clause to the SQL query.

    Similarly, an attacker can craft a request such that `params[:token]` will
    return an empty hash.  An empty hash will eliminate the WHERE clause of the
    query, but can bypass the `nil?` check.

    Note that this impacts not only dynamic finders (`find_by_*`) but also
    relations (`User.where(:name => params[:name])`).

    All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
    work arounds immediately. All users running an affected release should upgrade
    immediately. Please note, this vulnerability is a variant of CVE-2012-2660,
    CVE-2012-2694, and CVE-2013-0155.  Even if you upgraded to address those
    issues, you must take action again.

    If this chance in behavior impacts your application, you can manually decode
    the original values from the request like so:

        `ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(request.body)`

    Workarounds
    -----------
    This problem can be mitigated by casting the parameter to a string before
    passing it to Active Record.  For example:

      ```ruby
        unless params[:token].nil? || params[:token].to_s.empty?
          user = User.find_by_token(params[:token].to_s)
          user.reset_password!
        end

    This vulnerability is similar to [CVE-2012-2660][2], CVE-2012-2694 and
    [CVE-2013-0155][3].

    ### Details   {#details}

    Due to the way ActiveRecord interprets parameters in combination with
    the way that JSON parameters are parsed, it is possible for an attacker
    to issue unexpected database queries with `IS NULL` or empty `WHERE`
    clauses. This issue does *not* let an attacker insert arbitrary values
    into an SQL query, however they can cause the query to check for `NULL`
    or eliminate a `WHERE` clause when most users wouldn\'t expect it.

    For example, a system has password reset with token functionality:

            unless params[:token].nil?
              user = User.find_by_token(params[:token])
              user.reset_password!
            end

    An attacker can craft a request such that `params[:token]` will return
    `[nil]`. The `[nil]` value will bypass the test for nil, but will still
    add an `IN ('xyz', NULL)` clause to the SQL query.

    Similarly, an attacker can craft a request such that `params[:token]`
    will return an empty hash. An empty hash will eliminate the WHERE clause
    of the query, but can bypass the `nil?` check.

    Note that this impacts not only dynamic finders (`find_by_*`) but also
    relations (`User.where(:name => params[:name])`).

    \nWhen using the nested attributes feature in ActiveRecord you can prevent
    the destruction of associated records by passing the `allow_destroy:
    false` option to the `accepts_nested_attributes_for` method. However due
    to a change in the commit [a9b4b5d][1] the `_destroy` flag prevents the
    `:reject_if` proc from being called because it assumes that the record
    will be destroyed anyway. However this isn\'t true if `:allow_destroy`
    is false so this leads to changes that would have been rejected being
    applied to the record.

  title: SQL Injection
  description: |
    [ActiveRecord][1] is the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) that comes
    out-of-the-box with Rails. It plays the role of *Model* in the MVC
    architecture employed by Rails.

    Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that may allow carrying out an SQL
    injection attack. The issue is due to the PostgreSQL adapter for
    ActiveRecord not properly sanitizing user-supplied input when quoting
    `ranges`. This may allow a remote attacker to inject or manipulate SQL
    queries in the back-end database, allowing for the manipulation or
    disclosure of arbitrary data.

    ### Details   {#details}

    PostgreSQL supports a number of unique data types which are not present
    in other supported databases. A bug in the SQL quoting code in
    ActiveRecord can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL using
    carefully crafted values.

    Only applications which query against either `bitstring` or `range`
    types are vulnerable. The particular data types affected depend on the
    version of Rails you\'re using, but the vulnerable code will look the
    same. Vulnerable code will take either take the form of:

          Model.where(bitstring: params[:some_value])

    \n[ActiveRecord][1] is the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) that comes
    out-of-the-box with Rails. It plays the role of *Model* in the MVC
    architecture employed by Rails.

    Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that may allow carrying out an SQL
    injection attack. The issue is due to the PostgreSQL adapter for
    ActiveRecord not properly sanitizing user-supplied input when quoting
    `ranges`. This may allow a remote attacker to inject or manipulate SQL
    queries in the back-end database, allowing for the manipulation or
    disclosure of arbitrary data.

    ### Details   {#details}

    PostgreSQL supports a number of unique data types which are not present
    in other supported databases. A bug in the SQL quoting code in
    ActiveRecord can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL using
    carefully crafted values.

    Only applications which query against either `bitstring` or `range`
    types are vulnerable. The particular data types affected depend on the
    version of Rails you\'re using, but the vulnerable code will look the
    same. Vulnerable code will take either take the form of:

          Model.where(bitstring: params[:some_value])
          Model.where(range: params[:from]..params[:to])

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [ActiveRecord][1] is the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) that comes
    out-of-the-box with Rails. It plays the role of *Model* in the MVC
    architecture employed by Rails.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass via the `attr_protected` method of the Active Record. The issue
    is triggered during the handling of a specially crafted request, which
    may allow a remote attacker to bypass protection mechanisms and alter
    values that would otherwise be protected.

  title: JSON Parameter Parsing Query Bypass
  description: |
    [ActiveRecord][1] is the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) that comes
    out-of-the-box with Rails. It plays the role of *Model* in the MVC
    architecture employed by Rails.

    Affected versions of this package are vulenrable to JSON Parameter
    Parsing Query Bypass due to an error with the way it handles parameters
    combined with an error during the parsing of the JSON parameters. This
    may allow a remote attacker to bypass restrictions and issue unexpected
    database queries with `IS NULL` or empty `WHERE` clauses, and forcing
    the query to unexpectedly check for `NULL` or eliminate a `WHERE`
    clause.

  title: SQL Injection
  description: |
    [ActiveRecord][1] is the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) that comes
    out-of-the-box with Rails. It plays the role of *Model* in the MVC
    architecture employed by Rails.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL Injection. Due
    to the way dynamic finders in ActiveRecord extract options from method
    parameters, a method parameter can mistakenly be used as a scope.
    Carefully crafted requests can use the scope to inject arbitrary SQL.

    [ActiveRecord][1] is the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) that comes

    architecture employed by Rails.

    The vulnerability may allow an attacker to carry out an SQL injection
    attack. The issue is due to the ActiveRecord class not properly
    sanitizing user-supplied input to the `where` method. This may allow an
    attacker to inject or manipulate SQL queries in an application built on
    Ruby on Rails, allowing for the manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary
    data.

  title: Unsafe Query Generation
  description: |
    [ActiveRecord][1] is the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) that comes
    out-of-the-box with Rails. It plays the role of *Model* in the MVC
    architecture employed by Rails.

    The vulnerability lies within the way ActiveRecord handles parameters in
    conjunction with the way Rack parses query parameters. This issue may
    allow an attacker to inject arbitrary `IS NULL` clauses in to
    application SQL queries. This may also allow an attacker to have the SQL
    query check for `NULL` in arbitrary places.
