  title: HTTP Request Smuggling
  description: |
    [agoo][1] is a fast HTTP server supporting rack.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Request
    Smuggling. HTTP pipelining issues and request smuggling attacks might be
    possible due to incorrect Content-Length and Transfer encoding header
    parsing.

    It is possible conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks by sending the
    `Content-Length` header twice. Furthermore, invalid Transfer Encoding
    headers were found to be parsed as valid which could be leveraged for
    TE:CL smuggling attacks.

    By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache,
    perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests
    other than their own.
