  title: HTTP Request Smuggling
  description: |
    [agoo][1] is a fast HTTP server supporting rack.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Request
    Smuggling. HTTP pipelining issues and request smuggling attacks might be
    possible due to incorrect Content-Length and Transfer encoding header
    parsing.

    It is possible to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks where `agoo` is
    used as part of a chain of backend servers due to insufficient
    `Content-Length` and `Transfer Encoding` parsing.
