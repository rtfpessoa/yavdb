    [`passenger`][1] is a modern web server and application server for Ruby,
    Python and Node.js, optimized for performance, low memory usage and ease
    of use.

    Affected versions of this gem make it possible for clients to overwrite
    headers set by the server.

    `passenger` 5 uses an SCGI-inspired format to pass headers to
    Ruby/Python applications, while `passenger` 4 uses an SCGI-inspired
    format to pass headers to all applications. This implies a conversion to
    `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` whereby the difference between characters
    like `-` and `_` is lost.

  title: Privilege Escalation

    [`passenger`][1] is a modern web server and application server for Ruby,
    Python and Node.js, optimized for performance, low memory usage and ease
    of use.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Privilege Escalation,
    due to insecure tmp file names. If an attacker has access to the system,
    they could conduct a symlink attack in the `/tmp` files and overwrite
    these files when the `passenger-install-nginx-module` was run, resulting
    in the attacker gaining the privileges of the user running the task.

  title: Arbitrary File Write
  description: |
    [passenger][1] is a modern web server and application server for Ruby,
    Python and Node.js, optimized for performance, low memory usage and ease
    of use.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Write. During the spawning of a malicious Passenger-managed application,
    SpawningKit allows such applications to replace key files or directories
    in the spawning communication directory with symlinks. This then could
    result in arbitrary reads and writes, which in turn can result in
    information disclosure and privilege escalation.

  title: Insecure Permissions
  description: |
    [passenger][1] is a modern web server and application server for Ruby,
    Python and Node.js, optimized for performance, low memory usage and ease
    of use.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure
    Permissions. Given a Passenger-spawned application process that reports
    that it listens on a certain Unix domain socket, if any of the parent
    directories of said socket are writable by a normal user that is not the
    application\'s user, then that non-application user can swap that
    directory with something else, resulting in traffic being redirected to
    a non-application user\'s process through an alternative Unix domain
    socket.

  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [passenger][1] is a modern web server and application server for Ruby,
    Python and Node.js, optimized for performance, low memory usage and ease
    of use.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. Passenger-managed malicious application, upon spawning a child
    process, could report an arbitrary different `PID` back to Passenger\'s
    process manager. If the malicious application then generates an error,
    it would cause Passenger\'s process manager to kill said reported
    arbitrary `PID`.
