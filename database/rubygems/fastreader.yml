  title: Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |
    [`fastreader`][1] is a terminal-based feed reader. Affected versions of
    this gem are vulnerable to arbitrary command execution due to
    mishandling of specially crafted input passed via a URL that contains a
    `;` character. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to
    potentially execute arbitrary commands.
