  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`zipruby`][1] is Ruby bindings for libzip.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). Heap-based buffer overflow in the zip\_readcdir function in
    zip\_open.c in libzip 0.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
    zip archive with the number of directories set to 0, related to an
    \"incorrect loop construct.\"

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`zipruby`][1] is Ruby bindings for libzip.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. Integer overflow in the `_zip_readcdir` function in
    zip\_open.c in libzip 0.10 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
    code via the size and offset values for the central directory in a zip
    archive, which triggers \"improper restrictions of operations within the
    bounds of a memory buffer\" and an information leak.
