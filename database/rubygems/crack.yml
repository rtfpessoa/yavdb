  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`crack`][1] is a gem for parsing JSON and XML.

    Affected versions of this gem are vulnerable because they do not
    properly restrict casts of string values. This may allow an attacker to
    execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service (DoS).
