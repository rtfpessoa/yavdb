  title: HTTP Request Smuggling
  description: |
    [webrick][1] is a HTTP server toolkit that can be configured as an HTTPS
    server, a proxy server, and a virtual-host server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Request
    Smuggling. It was too tolerant against an invalid Transfer-Encoding
    header. This may lead to inconsistent interpretation between WEBrick and
    some HTTP proxy servers, which may allow the attacker to \"smuggle\" a
    request.
