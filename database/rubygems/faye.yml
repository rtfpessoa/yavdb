  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [faye][1] is a simple pub/sub messaging for the web.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. The Server parses channels in a way that means any channel
    namespaced under `/meta/subscribe` will also work as a subscription
    request. For example if the client sends a message to the channel
    `/meta/subscribe/x`, that will bypass most authentication extensions but
    will still be interpreted by the server as a subscription request, and
    the client will be subscribed to the requested channel. The client has
    thus bypassed the user\'s access control policy.
