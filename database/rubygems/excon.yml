  title: Race condition when using persistent connections
  description: |-
    There was a race condition around persistent connections, where a connection
    which is interrupted (such as by a timeout) would leave data on the socket.
    Subsequent requests would then read this data, returning content from the
    previous response. The race condition window appears to be short, and it
    would be difficult to purposefully exploit this.

    Users can workaround the problem by disabling persistent connections, though
    this may cause performance implications.

  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [`excon`][1] is Extended http(s) CONnections.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle
    (MitM) attacks due to attacks due to downloading gems over an insecure
    protocol. Without a secure connection, it is possible for an attacker to
    intercept this connection and alter the packages received. In serious
    cases, this may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host
    server.

    You can read more about `Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)` on our [blog][2].
