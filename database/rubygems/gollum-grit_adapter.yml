    gollum-grit_adapter Search Functionality Allows Arbitrary Command

  title: Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |
    [`gollum-grit_adapter`][1] is an adapter for Gollum to use Grit at the
    backend. Affected versions of this gem are vulnerable to arbitrary
    command execution.

    Grit implements its search functionality by shelling out to `git grep`.
    In turn, `git grep` takes a `-O` or `--open-files-in-pages` option that
    will pipe the results of `grep` to an arbitrary process. By failing to
    properly sanitize user input search parameters, an attacker can thus
    perform command execution.

    Note that the grep result must find the string `master` (or whatever is
    the default branch that gollum uses) in any of the wiki\'s documents for
    this to succeed.
