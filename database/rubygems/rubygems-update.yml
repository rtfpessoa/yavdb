  title: Delete directory using symlink when decompressing tar
  description: |
    A Directory Traversal issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.7.6 and later
    through 3.0.2. Before making new directories or touching files (which now
    include path-checking code for symlinks), it would delete the target
    destination. If that destination was hidden behind a symlink, a malicious gem
    could delete arbitrary files on the user’s machine, presuming the attacker
    could guess at paths. Given how frequently gem is run as sudo, and how
    predictable paths are on modern systems (/tmp, /usr, etc.), this could
    likely lead to data loss or an unusable system.

  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
  description: "[rubygems-update][1] is a inbuilt rubygem for updating rubygems.\n\nAffected
    versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression\nDenial of Service
    (ReDoS). Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in\n`Gem::Version::ANCHORED_VERSION_PATTERN`
    in `lib/rubygems/version.rb` as\nused in Ruby 1.9.0 through 2.0.0p247, allows
    remote attackers to cause a\ndenial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted
    gem version that\ntriggers a large amount of backtracking in a regular expression.
    NOTE:\nthis issue is due to an incomplete fix for `CVE-2013-4287`.\n\n\n\n[1]:
    https://rubygems.org/\n\\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks,
    all aimed at\nmaking a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users.
    There\nare many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network\npipes
    to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many\nmachines (a Distributed
    Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending\ncrafted requests that cause a system
    to crash or take a disproportional\namount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular
    expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of\nService attack. Regular
    expressions are incredibly powerful, but they\naren\\'t very intuitive and can
    ultimately end up making it easy for\nattackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s
    take the following regular expression as an example:\n\n    regex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n{:
    .language-js}\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n\n* `A`
    The string must start with the letter \\'A\\'\n* `(B|C+)+` The string must then
    follow the letter A with either the\n  letter \\'B\\' or some number of occurrences
    of the letter \\'C\\' (the\n  `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end
    of this section\n  states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n*
    `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a \\'D\\'\n\nThe expression
    would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD`\nand `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt
    most cases, it doesn\\'t take very long for a regex engine to find a\nmatch:\n\n
    \   $ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n    0.04s
    user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n    \n    $ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n
    \   1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n{: .language-bash}\n\nThe entire
    process of testing it against a 30 characters long string\ntakes around ~52ms.
    But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly\ntwo seconds to complete the
    test, over ten times as long as it took to\ntest a valid string. The dramatic
    difference is due to the way regular\nexpressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex
    engines will work very similarly (with minor differences).\nThe engine will match
    the first possible way to accept the current\ncharacter and proceed to the next
    one. If it then fails to match the\nnext one, it will backtrack and see if there
    was another way to digest\nthe previous character. If it goes too far down the
    rabbit hole only to\nfind out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many
    characters\nhave multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps
    can\nbecome very large, resulting in what is known as *catastrophic\nbacktracking*.\n\nLet\\'s
    look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a\nshorter string: \\\"ACCCX\\\".
    While it seems fairly straightforward, there\nare still four different ways that
    the engine could match those three\nC\\'s:\n\n1.  CCC\n2.  CC+C\n3.  C+CC\n4.
    \ C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of
    them\npotentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the\nother
    steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger][1] to\nsee the engine
    has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine\nthe string doesn\\'t
    match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string\njust
    continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C\\'s | Number of steps |\n|----------\n|
    ACCCX | 3 | 38 |\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71 |\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136 |\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX
    | 14 | 65,553 |\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C\\'s, the engine has to
    take over\n65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme\nsituations
    can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to\ninput size, as shown
    above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and\ncan cause the service to excessively
    consume CPU, resulting in a Denial\nof Service.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://regex101.com/debugger\n"

  title: Directory Traversal
  description: |
    [rubygems-update][1] is a inbuilt rubygem for updating rubygems.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal.
    Gem installation can result in the gem writing to arbitrary filesystem
    locations during installation. This attack appears to be exploitable via
    the victim installing a malicious gem.



    [1]: https://rubygems.org/
    \nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to
    access files and directories that are stored outside the intended
    folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and
    its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to
    access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including
    application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.

    Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two
    types:

    * **Information Disclosure**\: Allows the attacker to gain information
      about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on
      the system.

    `st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a
    [vulnerability of this type][1]. In our example, we will serve files
    from the `public` route.

    If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in
    turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.

        curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa

    **Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).

    * **Writing arbitrary files**\: Allows the attacker to create or replace
      existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as
      `Zip-Slip`.

    One way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds
    path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets
    concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the
    final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a
    configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code,
    the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite
    easily.

    The following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and
    one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in
    traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/`
    overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

        2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt

  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |+
    [rubygems-update][1] is a inbuilt rubygem for updating rubygems.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS). in gem server display of homepage attribute. This attack appears
    to be exploitable via the victim browsing to a malicious gem on a
    vulnerable gem server.



    [1]: https://rubygems.org/
    \nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a
    legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as
    originating from a trusted source.

    This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web
    application then delivers that data to its users along with other
    trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly
    executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side
    languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that
    are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.

    ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is
    exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this
    manipulation is the top method for securing code against this
    vulnerability.

    Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and
    particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those
    characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example,
    in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in
    order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while
    within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious
    content is injected into an application that escapes special characters
    and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those
    characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser
    if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this
    way the attempted attack is diverted.

    The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP
    HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to
    expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and
    functionality and deliver malware.

    ### Types of attacks   {#types-of-attacks}

    There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:

    | Type | Origin | Description |
    |----------
    | **Stored** | Server | The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link. |
    | **Reflected** | Server | The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. |
    | **DOM-based** | Client | The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data. |
    | **Mutated** |  | The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters. |

    ### Affected environments   {#affected-environments}

    The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:

    * Web servers
    * Application servers
    * Web application environments

    ### How to prevent   {#how-to-prevent}

    This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically
    protect your code:

    * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back,
      ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing
      anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters
      during searches.
    * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces
      to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.
    * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.
    * Redirect invalid requests.
    * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP
      addresses, and invalidate those sessions.
    * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to
      disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.
    * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your
      code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [rubygems-update][1] is a inbuilt rubygem for updating rubygems.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. RubyGems version 2.6.12 and earlier fails to validate
    specification names, allowing a maliciously crafted gem to potentially
    overwrite any file on the filesystem.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [rubygems-update][1] is a inbuilt rubygem for updating rubygems.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). Vulnerable to maliciously crafted gem specifications that can
    cause a denial of service attack against RubyGems clients who have
    issued a `query` command.



    [1]: https://rubygems.org/
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: DNS Hijack Attack
  description: |
    [rubygems-update][1] is a inbuilt rubygem for updating rubygems.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to DNS Hijack Attack.
    It does not validate the hostname when fetching gems or making API
    requests, which allows remote attackers to redirect requests to
    arbitrary domains via a crafted DNS SRV record with a domain that is
    suffixed with the original domain name, aka a DNS hijack attack. NOTE:
    this vulnerability exists because to an incomplete fix for
    `CVE-2015-3900`.

    [rubygems-update][1] is a inbuilt rubygem for updating rubygems.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM). It can redirect HTTPS connections to HTTP, which makes it easier
    for remote attackers to observe or modify a gem during installation via
    a man-in-the-middle attack.
