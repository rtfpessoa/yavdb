  title: Improper Certificate Validation
  description: |
    [faye-websocket][1] is a Standards-compliant WebSocket server and
    client.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Certificate
    Validation in TLS handshakes. The `Faye::WebSocket::Client` class uses
    the `EM::Connection#start_tls` method in EventMachine to implement the
    TLS handshake whenever a `wss:` URL is used for the connection. This
    method does not implement certificate verification by default, meaning
    that it does not check that the server presents a valid and trusted TLS
    certificate for the expected hostname.
