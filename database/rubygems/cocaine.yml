  title: Arbitrary Command Injection
  description: |+
    [`cocaine`][1] is a library for doing command lines.

    Affected versions of this gem are vulnerable to an attacker injecting
    hostile commands into a command line via a crafted hash object which is
    not properly escaped. This is due to the method of variable
    interpolation used by the gem, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary
    commands via a crafted `has` object, related to recursive variable
    interpolation.



    [1]: https://rubygems.org/gems/cocaine
    \nThe impact is lessened on Ruby version 1.8.\* because hashes are not
    ordered by default, so an attacker must rely on luck for the attack to
    work.

    An attack of this sort cannot take place if there is only one value
    being interpolated into the command line.
