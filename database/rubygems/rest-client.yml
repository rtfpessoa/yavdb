  title: 'rubygem-rest-client: session fixation vulnerability via Set-Cookie headers
    in 30x redirection responses'
  description: |
    rest-client in abstract_response.rb improperly handles Set-Cookie headers on
    HTTP 30x redirection responses. Any cookies will be forwarded to the
    redirection target regardless of domain, path, or expiration.

    If you control a redirection source, you can cause rest-client to perform a
    request to any third-party domain with cookies of your choosing, which may be
    useful in performing a session fixation attack.

    If you control a redirection target, you can steal any cookies set by the
    third-party redirection request.

  title: Session Fixation
  description: |
    [`rest-client`][1] gem is an HTTP and REST client for Ruby. Affected
    versions of this gem improperly handle Set-Cookie headers on HTTP 30x
    redirection responses in `abstract_response.rb`. Any cookies will be
    forwarded to the redirection target regardless of domain, path, or
    expiration.

    If an attacker controls a redirection source, they can cause rest-client
    to perform a request to any third-party domain with cookies of their
    choosing, which may be useful in performing a Session Fixation attack.

    If an control a redirection target, you can steal any cookies set by the
    third-party redirection request.
