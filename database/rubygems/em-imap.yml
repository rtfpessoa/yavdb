  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [em-imap][1] is a gem that allows you to connect to an IMAP4rev1 server
    in a non-blocking fashion.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM). The hostname in a TLS server certificate is not verified. An
    attacker can assume the identity of a trusted server and introduce
    malicious data in an otherwise trusted place.
