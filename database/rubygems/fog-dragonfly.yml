    [`fog-dragonfly`][1] is an on-the-fly Rack-based image handling
    framework. This gem was renamed from `fog-dragonfly` to `dragonfly`.

    Affected versions of this gem are vulnerable to a remote attacker
    gaining read/write access to the filesystem, and executing arbitrary
    commands via a flaw in uploading &amp; processing. This is that is due
    to the gem failing to restrict arbitrary commands to imagemagicks
    convert.
