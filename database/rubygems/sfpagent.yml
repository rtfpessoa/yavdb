  title: sfpagent Gem for Ruby JSON[body] Module Name Remote Command Execution
  description: |
    sfpagent Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered as JSON[body]
    input is not properly sanitized when handling module names with shell
    metacharacters. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to execute
    arbitrary commands.

    of this gem are vulnerable to context-dependent attackers to execute
    arbitrary commands, due to no proper sanitization in the `JSON[body]`
    when handling module names with shell metacharacters.
