  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: |
    [solidus\_frontend][1] is a cart and storefront for the Solidus
    e-commerce project.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation. It allows a malicious customer to craft request data with
    parameters that allow changing the address of the current order without
    changing the shipment costs associated with the new shipment. All stores
    with at least two shipping zones and different costs of shipment per
    zone are impacted.
