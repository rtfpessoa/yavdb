  title: Net::LDAP for Ruby lib/net/ldap/password.rb SSHA Password Generation Weak
    Salt
  description: Net::LDAP for Ruby contains a flaw in lib/net/ldap/password.rb. The
    issue is due to the program generating SSHA passwords with a weak salt value that
    is between 0 and 999. This may allow a local attacker to more easily gain access
    to password information.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [`net-ldap`][1] implements client access for the Lightweight Directory
    Access Protocol (LDAP), an IETF standard protocol for accessing
    distributed directory services. Affected versions of this gem generate
    SSHA passwords with a weak salt value that is between 0 and 999. This
    may allow a local attacker to more easily gain access to password
    information.

    [Net-ldap][1] implements client access for the Lightweight Directory
    Access Protocol (LDAP), an IETF standard protocol for accessing
    distributed directory services.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM) attacks as it did not properly validate SSL certificates. A
    malicious host could connect to the server, making it to believe it is a
    trusted host.
