    attacker manages to steal a remember me cookie and the user does not change
    the password frequently, the cookie can be used to gain access to the

    Devise contains a flaw that allows a remote, user-assisted attacker to

  description: |
    [`devise`][1] is an authentication framework for Rails with Warden.

    Affected versions allow an attacker to craft a malformed request in
    order to bypass security restrictions, potentially gaining control of
    other accounts. The vulnerability lies in a problematic type conversion
    of database queries against certain databases.

  title: Non Unique Authentication Cookie Values
  description: |
    [`devise`][1] is an authentication framework for Rails with Warden.

    Affected versions implement the \'remember me\' functionality by using
    the same cookie for the user across all their devices. This increases
    the chance of the user identity being stolen. Furthermore, it does not
    allow to selectively revoke a specific cookie value, forcing \'all or
    none\' if the user wishes to sign out. The fix introduces a timestamp to
    the cookie value, making it unique per device.
