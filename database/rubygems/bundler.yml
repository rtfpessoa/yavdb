    Installation Spoofing
  description: |
    Bundler Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered when handling
    a gemfile that contains multiple top-level source lines. This may allow a
    context-dependent attacker to install specially crafted gems on a remote
    system, leading to arbitrary code execution.

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |+
    [`bundler`][1] is a dependencies manager. Affected versions of this Gem
    contain a flaw that is triggered when handling a Gemfile that contains
    multiple top-level source lines. This may allow a gem to be installed
    from an unintended source server, allowing an attacker to install
    specially crafted gems, leading to arbitrary code execution.



    [1]: https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler
    \nAny Gemfile with multiple top-level `source` lines cannot reliably
    control the gem server that a particular gem is fetched from. As a
    result, Bundler might install the wrong gem if more than one source
    provides a gem with the same name. An attacker might create a malicious
    gem on Rubygems.org with the same name as a commonly-used GitHub gem.
    From that point forward, running `bundle install` might result in the
    malicious gem being used instead of the expected one.

    It is possible to work around the issue by removing all but one `source`
    line from the Gemfile. Gems from other sources must be installed via the
    `:git` option, which is not susceptible to this issue, or unpacked into
    the application repository and used via the `:path` option.

    Unfortunately, backporting a fix for this issue proved impractical, as
    previous versions of Bundler lacked the ability to distinguish between
    gem servers.

  title: Arbitrary File Deletion
  description: |
    [`bundler`][1] is a dependencies manager. Affected versions of this gem
    use the `FileUtils.rm_rf` function to delete the Bundler tmp folder.
    This method is vulnerable when:

    * One of parent directories or removing directory tree are world
      writable (including /tmp, whose permission is 1777),
    * The current process has root privileges.
    * The system has symbolic link. The fix is to use
      `FileUtils.remove_entry_secure`. See the [Ruby Docs][2] for more
      information.

    This bug was thought to be fixed in Bundler 1.7 [here][2],

    [2]: https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-BUNDLER-20189
    \nBundler allows the user to specify sources from which Ruby gems are
    installed. If a secondary source is specified, even if scoped to a
    specific gem, that source is silently applied to all declared gems. This
    allows an attacker to introduce arbitrary code into an application via
    gem name collision on the secondary source, which will unexpectedly (and
    without warning) take priority over the primary source.
