    Bundler Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered when handling
    a gemfile that contains multiple top-level source lines. This may allow a
    context-dependent attacker to install specially crafted gems on a remote
    system, leading to arbitrary code execution.

    \nAny Gemfile with multiple top-level `source` lines cannot reliably
    control the gem server that a particular gem is fetched from. As a
    result, Bundler might install the wrong gem if more than one source
    provides a gem with the same name. An attacker might create a malicious
    gem on Rubygems.org with the same name as a commonly-used GitHub gem.
    From that point forward, running `bundle install` might result in the
    malicious gem being used instead of the expected one.

    It is possible to work around the issue by removing all but one `source`
    line from the Gemfile. Gems from other sources must be installed via the
    `:git` option, which is not susceptible to this issue, or unpacked into
    the application repository and used via the `:path` option.

    Unfortunately, backporting a fix for this issue proved impractical, as
    previous versions of Bundler lacked the ability to distinguish between
    gem servers.
