  title: extlib Gem for Ruby Type Casting Parameter Parsing Remote Code Execution
  description: |
    extlib Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered when a type casting
    error occurs during the parsing of parameters. This may allow a
    context-dependent attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.
