  title: Directory traversal vulnerability in rubyzip
  description: |
    The Zip::File component in the rubyzip gem before 1.2.1 for Ruby has a
    directory traversal vulnerability. If a site allows uploading of .zip files,
    an attacker can upload a malicious file that uses "../" pathname substrings to
    write arbitrary files to the filesystem.

  title: Directory Traversal in rubyzip
  description: |
    rubyzip version 1.2.1 and earlier contains a Directory Traversal vulnerability
    in Zip::File component that can result in write arbitrary files to the filesystem.
    If a site allows uploading of .zip files, an attacker can upload a malicious file
    which contains symlinks or files with absolute pathnames "../" to write arbitrary
    files to the filesystem.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |
    [rubyzip][1] is a ruby module for reading and writing zip files.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). It is possible for a crafted ZIP file to bypass application
    checks on ZIP entry sizes because data about the uncompressed size can
    be spoofed. This allows attackers to cause a denial of service through
    maximum disk consumption. By default, the `validate_entry_sizes` option
    should be set to true, so that callers can trust an entry\'s reported
    size when using `extract`.
