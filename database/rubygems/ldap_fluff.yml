  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [`ldap_fluff`][1] is a simple library for binding &amp; group querying
    on top of various LDAP implementations. Affected versions of the gem are
    vulnerable to authentication bypass. When using Microsoft Active
    Directory server as the authentication back-end, authentication is no
    longer being enforced, allowing a remote attacker to trivially bypass
    it.
