  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [omniauth][1] is a generalized Rack framework for multiple-provider
    authentication.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). An attacker may be allowed to be connected to the user
    without the user\'s intent, interaction, or feedback. This permits a
    secondary account to be able to sign into the web application as the
    primary account.

    **Note:** The package is only vulnerable when used as part of the Ruby
    on Rails framework.
