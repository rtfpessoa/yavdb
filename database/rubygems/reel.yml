  title: HTTP Request Smuggling
  description: |
    [reel][1] is a fast, non-blocking \"evented\" web server built on
    http\_parser.rb, websocket-driver, Celluloid::IO, and nio4r.

    Note: This project is deprecated, and is not maintained anymore.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Request
    Smuggling. HTTP pipelining issues and request smuggling attacks might be
    possible due to incorrect Content-Length and Transfer encoding header
    parsing.

    It is possible conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks by sending the
    `Content-Length` header twice. Furthermore, invalid Transfer Encoding
    headers were found to be parsed as valid which could be leveraged for
    TE:CL smuggling attacks.

    By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache,
    perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests
    other than their own.
