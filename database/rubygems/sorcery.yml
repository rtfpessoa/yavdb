  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [sorcery][1] is a package that provides common authentication needs such
    as signing in/out, activating by email and resetting password.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. There is a brute force vulnerability when using password
    authentication via Sorcery. The brute force protection submodule will
    prevent a brute force attack for the defined lockout period, but once
    expired, protection will not be re-enabled until a user or malicious
    actor logs in successfully. This does not affect users that do not use
    the built-in brute force protection submodule, nor users that use
    permanent account lockout.
