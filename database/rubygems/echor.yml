  description: |
    Echor Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in backplane.rb in the perform_request
    function that is triggered when a semi-colon (;) is injected into a username
    or password. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to inject arbitrary
    commands if the gem is used in a rails application.

    [`Echor`][1] is a wrapper for echo. Affected versions of this gem
    contain a flaw in `backplane.rb` in the `perform_request` function that
    is triggered when a semi-colon `;` is injected into a username or
    password. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to inject
    arbitrary commands if the gem is used in a rails application.
