  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [oauth][1] is a ruby gem that implements both OAuth clients and servers
    in Ruby applications.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM). `lib/oauth/consumer.rb` does not verify server X.509
    certificates if a certificate bundle cannot be found, which allows
    man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive
    information.
