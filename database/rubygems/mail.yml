    Mail Gem for Ruby contains a flaw related to the failure to properly sanitise
    input passed from an email from address in the 'deliver()' function in
    'lib/mail/network/delivery_methods/sendmail.rb' before being used as a
    command line argument. This may allow a remote attacker to inject arbitrary
    shell commands.

  title: SMTP command injection
  description: |
    Because Mail does not disallow CRLF in email addresses, an attacker can
    inject SMTP commands in specially crafted email addresses passed to
    RCPT TO and MAIL FROM.

    Not affected by this vulnerability:
      * Ruby 2.4.0+ with a fix for CVE-2015-9096.
      * Applications that do not use SMTP delivery.
      * Applications that validate email addresses to not include CRLF.

    The injection attack is described in Terada, Takeshi. "SMTP Injection via
    Recipient Email Addresses." 2015. The attacks described in the paper
    (Terada, p. 4) can be applied to the library without any modification.

  title: Directory Traversal
  description: |
    [`mail`][1] is a Ruby Mail handler gem.

    Affected versions of this gem allow a remote attacker to traverse
    outside of a restricted path. This is due to the program not properly
    sanitizing user input, specifically directory traversal style attacks
    (e.g. `../../`) supplied via the `to` parameter within the delivery
    method.

    This directory traversal attack would allow the attacker to modify
    arbitrary files.



    [1]: https://rubygems.org/gems/mail
    \nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to
    access files and directories that are stored outside the intended
    folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and
    its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to
    access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including
    application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.

    Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two
    types:

    * **Information Disclosure**\: Allows the attacker to gain information
      about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on
      the system.

    `st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a
    [vulnerability of this type][1]. In our example, we will serve files
    from the `public` route.

    If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in
    turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.

        curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa

    **Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).

    * **Writing arbitrary files**\: Allows the attacker to create or replace
      existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as
      `Zip-Slip`.

    One way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds
    path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets
    concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the
    final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a
    configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code,
    the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite
    easily.

    The following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and
    one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in
    traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/`
    overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

        2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
        2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys
