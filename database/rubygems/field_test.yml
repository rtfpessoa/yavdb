  title: Arbitrary Variants Via Query Parameters
  description: |
    Due to unvalidated input, an attacker can pass in
    arbitrary variants via query parameters.

    If an application treats variants as trusted, this can
    lead to potential vulnerabilities like SQL injection
    or cross-site scripting (XSS). For instance:

    landing_page = field_test(:landing_page)
    Page.where("key = '#{landing_page}'")
  affected_package: field_test
  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 0.3.0"
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 0.3.1"
  package_manager: rubygems

  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: |
    [field\_test][1] is an A/B testing library for Rails.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation. A method call that is expected to return a value from a
    certain set of inputs can be made to return any input, which can be
    dangerous depending on how applications use it. If an application treats
    arbitrary variants as trusted, this can lead to a variety of potential
    vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
