  title: Denial of Service in uap-core when processing crafted User-Agent strings
  description: |-
    ### Impact
    Some regexes are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (REDoS) due to
    overlapping capture groups. This allows remote attackers to overload a server by
    setting the User-Agent header in an HTTP(S) request to maliciously crafted long
    strings.

    ### Patches
    Please update `uap-ruby` to &gt;= v2.6.0

  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
  description: |+
    [user\_agent\_parser][1] is a Ruby gem for parsing user agent strings
    with the help of BrowserScope\'s UA database.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression
    Denial of Service (ReDoS) when processing crafted `User-Agent` strings.

    This allows remote attackers to overload a server by setting the
    `User-Agent` header in an HTTP(S) request to maliciously crafted long
    strings.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
