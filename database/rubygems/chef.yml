  title: Missing Authentication
  description: |
    [`chef`][1] is a systems integration framework, built to bring the
    benefits of configuration management to your entire infrastructure.
    Affected versions of the package do not require administrative
    privileges for the create, destroy, and update methods, which allows
    remote authenticated users to manage user accounts via requests to the
    /users URI.
