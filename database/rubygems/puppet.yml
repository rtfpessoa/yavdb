  title: Arbitrary File Access
  description: |
    [`puppet`][1] is an automated configuration management tool. Affected
    versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Access via
    Symlink Attack. Puppet creates temporary files in `/tmp` with
    predictable names. These could be used by an attacker to cause a Denial
    of Service (DoS) attack by setting a symlink to some other file and
    waiting for puppet to overwrite it.

  title: Directory Traversal
  description: |
    [`puppet`][1] is an automated configuration management tool. Affected
    versions of the package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal via the
    SSLFile indirection base class. An Attacker could write any valid X.509
    Certificate Signing Request at any location on the disk.



    [1]: https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet
    \nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to
    access files and directories that are stored outside the intended
    folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and
    its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to
    access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including
    application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.

    Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two
    types:

    * **Information Disclosure**\: Allows the attacker to gain information
      about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on
      the system.

    `st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a
    [vulnerability of this type][1]. In our example, we will serve files
    from the `public` route.

    If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in
    turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.

        curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa

    **Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).

    * **Writing arbitrary files**\: Allows the attacker to create or replace
      existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as
      `Zip-Slip`.

    One way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds
    path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets
    concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the
    final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a
    configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code,
    the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite
    easily.

    The following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and
    one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in
    traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/`
    overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

        2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
        2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

  title: Local Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [`puppet`][1] is an automated configuration management tool. Affected
    versions of the package are vulnerable to Symlink Attack via a user\'s
    `.k5login` file. The k5login type is typically used to manage a file in
    the home directory of a user. The purpose of this file is to allow
    access to other users.

    The `.k5login` file previously wrote to the target file directly, as
    root, without doing anything to secure the file. If the `.k5login`file
    was replaced with a symlink, this would allow the owner of the home
    directory to replace any file on the system, including the `.k5login`
    file of a more privileged user, with the “correct” content of their own
    file.

    [`puppet`][1] is an automated configuration management tool. Affected
    versions of the package are vulnerable to Symlink Attack via a user\'s
    SSH `authorized_keys` field. A TOCTOU (time-of-check-to-time-of-use)
    race vulnerability was present in the `ssh_authorized_key` type. When
    the target file and directory did not exist, each of them would be
    created as root and later chowned to the user. This made it possible to
    replace either one with a symlink to an arbitrary file, which would then
    become owned by that user. This would allow local privilege escalation
    to root through standard TOCTOU attack techniques.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`puppet`][1] is an automated configuration management tool. Affected
    versions of the package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS)
    attacks.

    * By using the symlink vulnerability described in [CVE-2012-1986][2], it
      is possible to create a `memory consumption DoS` attack, due to the
      way Puppet sends files via REST requests, the thread handling the
      request will block forever.
    * A `filesystem DoS` attack is possible by constructing a marshaled form
      of a `Puppet::FileBucket::File` object, a malicious user can craft a
      REST request to have this object written to any place in the
      filesystem and fill it.



    [1]: https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet
    [2]: https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-PUPPET-20311
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  description: |
    [`puppet`][1] is an automated configuration management tool.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Agent Impersonation,
    due to a flaw in setups where certnames are set to host IP addresses. If
    an authenticated host with a certname of an IP address changes IP
    addresses, and a second host assumes the first host\'s former IP
    address, the second host will be treated by the puppet master as the

  title: Directory Traversal
  description: |
    [`puppet`][1] is an automated configuration management tool. Affected
    versions of the package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal when the
    `auth.conf` file enables deletion. An attacker may craft a Delete
    request and arbitrarily delete files on the puppet master and
    potentially cause a Denial of Service (DoS).



    [1]: https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet
    \nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to
    access files and directories that are stored outside the intended
    folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and
    its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to
    access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including
    application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.

    Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two
    types:

    * **Information Disclosure**\: Allows the attacker to gain information
      about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on
      the system.

    `st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a
    [vulnerability of this type][1]. In our example, we will serve files
    from the `public` route.

    If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in
    turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.

        curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa

    **Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).

    * **Writing arbitrary files**\: Allows the attacker to create or replace
      existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as
      `Zip-Slip`.

    One way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds
    path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets
    concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the
    final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a
    configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code,
    the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite
    easily.

    The following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and
    one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in
    traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/`
    overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

        2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
        2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

  title: Remote Code Execution
  description: |
    [`puppet`][1] is an automated configuration management tool. Affected
    versions of the package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution on
    agents configured to accept kick connections. If the agent has been
    configured to listen for incoming connections (`listen=true`), and the

    which could execute arbitrary code.

    **Notes:**

    * This vulnerability is not present in the default configuration of
      puppet agents.
    * The severity of this issue is exacerbated by the fact that puppet
      agents typically run as root.

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`puppet`][1] is an automated configuration management tool. Affected
    versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. An
    attacker could have Puppet execute malicious code by convincing a
    privileged user to change directories to one containing the malicious
    code and then run Puppet.

    **Note:** On platforms with Ruby 1.9.1 or earlier.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [`puppet`][1] is an automated configuration management tool. Affected
    versions of the package are vulnerable to Information Leakage.

    In Apache 2.4, SSLCARevocationCheck directive was added to mod\_ssl,
    which defaults it to none and must be explicitly configured. This
    setting enables checking of a certificate revocation list. The default
    Puppet master vhost config shipped with Puppet does not include this
    setting. If a Puppet master is set up to run with Apache 2.4, and this
    default vhost configuration file is used, the Puppet master will
    continue to honor a host\'s certificate even after it is revoked.
