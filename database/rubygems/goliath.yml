  title: HTTP Request Smuggling
  description: |
    [goliath][1] is an Async framework for writing API servers.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Request
    Smuggling. HTTP pipelining issues and request smuggling attacks might be
    possible due to incorrect Content-Length and Transfer encoding header
    parsing.

    It is possible to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks where `goliath`
    is used as part of a chain of backend servers due to insufficient
    `Content-Length` and `Transfer Encoding` parsing.
