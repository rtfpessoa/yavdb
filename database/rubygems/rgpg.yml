  title: rgpg Gem for Ruby lib/rgpg/gpg_helper.rb Remote Command Execution
  description: |
    rgpg Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the GpgHelper module
    (lib/rgpg/gpg_helper.rb). The issue is due to the program failing to properly
    sanitize user-supplied input before being used in the system() function for
    execution. This may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands.

  title: Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |
    [`rgpg`][1] is a wrapper around \"gpg\" command for file encryption.
    Affected versions of this gem are vulnerable to Arbitrary command
    execution via `GpgHelper` module (lib/rgpg/gpg\_helper.rb). The program
