  title: fileutils Gem for Ruby files_utils.rb /tmp File Symlink Arbitrary File Overwrite
  description: fileutils Gem for Ruby contains a flaw as the program creates temporary
    files insecurely. It is possible for a local attacker to use a symlink attack
    against temporary files created by files_utils.rb to cause the program to unexpectedly
    overwrite an arbitrary file.

  title: fileutils Gem for Ruby Temporary Directory Hijacking Weakness
  description: fileutils Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is due to the program not
    verifying the existence of a directory before attempting to create it. This may
    allow a local attacker to create the directory in advance, thus owning any files
    subsequently written to it.
