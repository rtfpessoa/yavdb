  title: Relies on undefined behavior of `char::from_u32_unchecked`
  description: |
    The Windows implementation of this crate relied on the behavior of
    `std::char::from_u32_unchecked` when its safety clause is violated.
    Even though this worked with Rust versions up to 1.42 (at least),
    that behavior could change with any new Rust version, possibly leading
    a security issue.

    The flaw was corrected in version 2.0.0.
