  title: Uncontrolled recursion leads to abort in deserialization
  description: |
    Affected versions of this crate did not properly check for recursion
    while deserializing aliases.

    This allows an attacker to make a YAML file with an alias referring
    to itself causing an abort.

    The flaw was corrected by checking the recursion depth.
