  title: Flaw in streaming state reset() functions can create incorrect results.
  description: "Affected versions of this crate did not properly reset a streaming
    state.\n\nResetting a streaming state, without finalising it first, creates incorrect
    results.\n \nThe flaw was corrected by not first checking if the state had already
    been reset, when calling reset().\n"
