  title: chan is end-of-life; use crossbeam-channel instead
  description: |
    **`chan` has reached its end-of-life and is now deprecated.**

    The intended successor of this crate is
    [`crossbeam-channel`](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/tree/master/crossbeam-channel).
    Its API is strikingly similar, but comes with a much better `select!` macro,
    better performance, a better test suite and an all-around better
    implementation.
