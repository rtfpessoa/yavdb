  title: Uncontrolled recursion leads to abort in deserialization
  description: |
    Affected versions of this crate did not prevent deep recursion while
    deserializing data structures.

    This allows an attacker to make a YAML file with deeply nested structures
    that causes an abort while deserializing it.

    The flaw was corrected by checking the recursion depth.
