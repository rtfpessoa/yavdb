  title: Flaw in Scalar::check_overflow allows side-channel timing attack
  description: |
    Versions of `libsecp256k1` prior to `0.3.1` did not execute
    Scalar::check_overflow in constant time.

    This allows an attacker to potentially leak information via a timing attack.

    The flaw was corrected by modifying Scalar::check_overflow to execute in
    constant time.
