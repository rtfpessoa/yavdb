  title: Stream callback function is not unwind safe
  description: "Affected versions of this crate is not panic safe within callback
    functions `stream_callback` and `stream_finished_callback`.\n\nThe call to user-provided
    closure might panic before a `mem::forget` call, which then causes a use after
    free that grants attacker to control the callback function pointer.\n\nThis allows
    an attacker to construct an arbitrary code execution .\n \nThe flaw was reported
    by Phosphorus15.\n"
