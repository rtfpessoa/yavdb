  title: MsQueue and SegQueue suffer from double-free
  description: |
    Even if an element is popped from a queue, crossbeam would run its
    destructor inside the epoch-based garbage collector. This is a source
    of double frees.

    The flaw was corrected by wrapping elements inside queues in a
    `ManuallyDrop`.

    Thanks to @c0gent for reporting the issue.
