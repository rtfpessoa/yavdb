  title: MultiDecoder::read() drops uninitialized memory of arbitrary type on panic
    in client code
  description: "Affected versions of libflate have set a field of an internal structure
    with a generic type to an uninitialized value in `MultiDecoder::read()` and reverted
    it to the original value after the function completed. However, execution of `MultiDecoder::read()`
    could be interrupted by a panic in caller-supplied `Read` implementation. This
    would cause `drop()` to be called on uninitialized memory of a generic type implementing
    `Read`. \n\nThis is equivalent to a use-after-free vulnerability and could allow
    an attacker to gain arbitrary code execution.\n \nThe flaw was corrected by aborting
    immediately instead of unwinding the stack in case of panic within `MultiDecoder::read()`.
    The issue was discovered and fixed by Shnatsel.\n"
