  title: Enum repr causing potential memory corruption
  description: |
    The attribute repr() added to enums to be compatible with C-FFI caused
    memory corruption on MSVC toolchain.

    arrayfire crates <= version 3.5.0 do not have this issue when used with
    Rust versions 1.27 or earlier. The issue only started to appear since
    Rust version 1.28.

    The issue seems to be interlinked with which version of Rust is being used.

    The issue was fixed in crate 3.6.0.
