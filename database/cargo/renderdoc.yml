  title: Internally mutating methods take immutable ref self
  description: |
    Affected versions of this crate exposed several methods which took `self` by
    immutable reference, despite the requesting the RenderDoc API to set a mutable
    value internally.

    This is technically unsound and calling these methods from multiple threads
    without synchronization could lead to unexpected and unpredictable behavior.

    The flaw was corrected in release 0.5.0.
