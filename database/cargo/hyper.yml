  title: HTTPS MitM vulnerability due to lack of hostname verification
  description: |
    When used on Windows platforms, all versions of Hyper prior to 0.9.4 did not
    perform hostname verification when making HTTPS requests.

    This allows an attacker to perform MitM attacks by preventing any valid
    CA-issued certificate, even if there's a hostname mismatch.

    The problem was addressed by leveraging rust-openssl's built-in support for
    hostname verification.

  title: headers containing newline characters can split messages
  description: |
    Serializing of headers to the socket did not filter the values for newline bytes (`\r` or `\n`),
    which allowed for header values to split a request or response. People would not likely include
    newlines in the headers in their own applications, so the way for most people to exploit this
    is if an application constructs headers based on unsanitized user input.

    This issue was fixed by replacing all newline characters with a space during serialization of
    a header value.
