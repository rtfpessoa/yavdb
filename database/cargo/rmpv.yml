  title: Unchecked vector pre-allocation
  description: |
    Affected versions of this crate pre-allocate memory on deserializing raw
    buffers without checking whether there is sufficient data available.

    This allows an attacker to do denial-of-service attacks by sending small
    msgpack messages that allocate gigabytes of memory.
