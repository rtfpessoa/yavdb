  title: Hostname verification skipped when custom root certs used
  description: |
    If custom root certificates were registered with a `ClientBuilder`, the
    hostname of the target server would not be validated against its presented leaf
    certificate.

    This issue was fixed by properly configuring the trust evaluation logic to
    perform that check.
