  title: crust repo has been archived; use libp2p instead
  description: |
    ** The `crust` crate repo was archived with no warning or explanation.**

    Given that it was archived with no warning or successor, there's not an
    official replacement but [`rust-libp2p`](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p)
    looks like it's got a similar feature set and is actively maintained.
