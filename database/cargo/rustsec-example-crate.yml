  title: Test advisory with associated example crate
  description: |
    This is a test advisory useful for verifying RustSec tooling and vulnerability
    detection pipelines are working correctly. Aside from the fact that it is filed
    against an example crate, it is otherwise considered by the Advisory Database
    itself to be a normal security advisory.

    It's filed against `rustsec-example-crate`, an otherwise completely empty crate
    with no functionality or code, which has two releases:

    - [v0.0.1] - *vulnerable* according to this advisory
    - [v1.0.0] - *patched* by this advisory

    (Technically there is a third release, v0.0.0, which is yanked, but otherwise
    identical to the v0.0.1 release)

    [v0.0.1]: https://crates.io/crates/rustsec-example-crate/0.0.1
    [v1.0.0]: https://crates.io/crates/rustsec-example-crate/1.0.0
