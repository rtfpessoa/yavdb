  title: Integer Overflow in HeaderMap::reserve() can cause Denial of Service
  description: |
    `HeaderMap::reserve()` used `usize::next_power_of_two()` to calculate the increased capacity.
    However, `next_power_of_two()` silently overflows to 0 if given a sufficently large number
    in release mode.

    If the map was not empty when the overflow happens,
    the library will invoke `self.grow(0)` and start infinite probing.
    This allows an attacker who controls the argument to `reserve()`
    to cause a potential denial of service (DoS).

    The flaw was corrected in 0.1.20 release of `http` crate.

  title: HeaderMap::Drain API is unsound
  description: |
    Affected versions of this crate incorrectly used raw pointer,
    which introduced unsoundness in its public safe API.

    [Failing to drop the Drain struct causes double-free](https://github.com/hyperium/http/issues/354),
    and [it is possible to violate Rust's alias rule and cause data race with Drain's Iterator implementation](https://github.com/hyperium/http/issues/355).

    The flaw was corrected in 0.1.20 release of `http` crate.
