  title: Stack overflow when parsing malicious DNS packet
  description: |
    There's a stack overflow leading to a crash when Trust-DNS's parses a
    malicious DNS packet.

    Affected versions of this crate did not properly handle parsing of DNS message
    compression (RFC1035 section 4.1.4). The parser could be tricked into infinite
    loop when a compression offset pointed back to the same domain name to be
    parsed.

    This allows an attacker to craft a malicious DNS packet which when consumed
    with Trust-DNS could cause stack overflow and crash the affected software.

    The flaw was corrected by trust-dns-proto 0.4.3 and upcoming 0.5.0 release.
