  title: Flaw in generativity allows out-of-bounds access
  description: |
    Affected versions of this crate did not properly implement the generativity,
    because the invariant lifetimes were not necessarily `drop`ped.

    This allows an attacker to mix up two arenas, using indices created from one
    arena with another one. This might lead to an out-of-bounds read or write
    access into the memory reserved for the arena.

    The flaw was corrected by implementing generativity correctly in version 0.4.0.
