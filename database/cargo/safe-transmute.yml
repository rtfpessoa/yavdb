  title: Vec-to-vec transmutations could lead to heap overflow/corruption
  description: |
    Affected versions of this crate switched the length and capacity arguments in the Vec::from_raw_parts() constructor,
    which could lead to memory corruption or data leakage.

    The flaw was corrected by using the constructor correctly.
