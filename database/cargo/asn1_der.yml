  title: Processing of maliciously crafted length fields causes memory allocation
    SIGABRTs
  description: "Affected versions of this crate tried to preallocate a vector for
    an arbitrary amount of bytes announced by the ASN.1-DER length field without further
    checks.\n\nThis allows an attacker to trigger a SIGABRT by creating length fields
    that announce more bytes than the allocator can provide.\n \nThe flaw was corrected
    by not preallocating memory.\n"
