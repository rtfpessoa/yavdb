  title: Use after free in ArcIntern::drop
  description: |
    `ArcIntern::drop` has a race condition where it can release memory
    which is about to get another user. The new user will get a reference
    to freed memory.

    Versions prior to 0.3.12 used stronger locking which avoided the problem.
