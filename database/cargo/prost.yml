  title: Parsing a specially crafted message can result in a stack overflow
  description: "Affected versions of this crate contained a bug in which decoding
    untrusted\ninput could overflow the stack.\n\nOn architectures with stack probes
    (like x86), this can be used for denial of\nservice attacks, while on architectures
    without stack probes (like ARM)\noverflowing the stack is unsound and can result
    in potential memory corruption\n(or even RCE).\n \nThe flaw was quickly corrected
    by @danburkert and released in version 0.6.1.\n"
