  title: SSL/TLS MitM vulnerability due to insecure defaults
  description: |
    All versions of rust-openssl prior to 0.9.0 contained numerous insecure defaults
    including off-by-default certificate verification and no API to perform hostname
    verification.

    Unless configured correctly by a developer, these defaults could allow an attacker
    to perform man-in-the-middle attacks.

    The problem was addressed in newer versions by enabling certificate verification
    by default and exposing APIs to perform hostname verification. Use the
    `SslConnector` and `SslAcceptor` types to take advantage of these new features
    (as opposed to the lower-level `SslContext` type).
