  title: Flaw in offset_of and span_of causes SIGILL, drops uninitialized memory of
    arbitrary type on panic in client code
  description: |
    Affected versions of this crate caused traps and/or memory unsafety by zero-initializing references.
    They also could lead to uninitialized memory being dropped if the field for which the offset is requested was behind a deref coercion, and that deref coercion caused a panic.

    The flaw was corrected by using `MaybeUninit`.
