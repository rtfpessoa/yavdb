  title: Crash causing Denial of Service attack
  description: "Server or client applications that call the SSL_check_chain() function
    during or after a TLS 1.3 \nhandshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference
    as a result of incorrect handling of the \n\"signature_algorithms_cert\" TLS extension.
    The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognised signature \nalgorithm is received
    from the peer. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial of \nService
    attack."
