  title: Large cookie Max-Age values can cause a denial of service
  description: |
    Affected versions of this crate use the `time` crate and the method
    `Duration::seconds` to parse the `Max-Age` duration cookie setting. This method
    will panic if the value is greater than 2^64/1000 and less than or equal to
    2^64, which can result in denial of service for a client or server.

    This flaw was corrected by explicitly checking for the `Max-Age` being in this
    integer range and clamping the value to the maximum duration value.
