  title: Flaw in CBOR deserializer allows stack overflow
  description: "Affected versions of this crate did not properly check if semantic
    tags were nested excessively during deserialization.\n\nThis allows an attacker
    to craft small (< 1 kB) CBOR documents that cause a stack overflow.\n \nThe flaw
    was corrected by limiting the allowed number of nested tags.\n"
