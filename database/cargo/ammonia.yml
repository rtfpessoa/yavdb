  title: Uncontrolled recursion leads to abort in HTML serialization
  description: |
    Affected versions of this crate did use recursion for serialization of HTML
    DOM trees.

    This allows an attacker to cause abort due to stack overflow by providing
    a pathologically nested input.

    The flaw was corrected by serializing the DOM tree iteratively instead.
