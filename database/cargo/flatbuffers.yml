  title: Unsound `impl Follow for bool`
  description: |
    The implementation of `impl Follow for bool` allows to reinterpret arbitrary bytes as a `bool`.

    In Rust `bool` has stringent requirements for its in-memory representation. Use of this function
    allows to violate these requirements and invoke undefined behaviour in safe code.
