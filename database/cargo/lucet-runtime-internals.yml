  title: sigstack allocation bug can cause memory corruption or leak
  description: |
    An embedding using affected versions of lucet-runtime configured to use
    non-default Wasm globals sizes of more than 4KiB, or compiled in debug mode
    without optimizations, could leak data from the signal handler stack to guest
    programs. This can potentially cause data from the embedding host to leak to
    guest programs or cause corruption of guest program memory.

    This flaw was resolved by correcting the sigstack allocation logic.
