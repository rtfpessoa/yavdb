  title: Buffer Overflow
  description: |
    [lz4][1] is a lossless compression algorithm, providing compression
    speed at 400 MB/s per core, scalable with multi-cores CPU.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in
    `LZ4_write32` (related to `LZ4_compress_destSize`), affecting
    applications that call `LZ4_compress_fast` with a large input. (This
    issue can also lead to data corruption.)

  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: |
    [lz4][1] is a lossless compression algorithm, providing compression
    speed at 400 MB/s per core, scalable with multi-cores CPU.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation. The `lz4_uncompress` function in `lib/lz4/lz4_decompress.c`
    on 32-bit platforms might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other
    impact via a crafted Literal Run that would be improperly handled by
    programs not complying with an API limitation.
