  title: Malicious Package
  description: |
    [MintegralAdSDK][1] is a malicious package. The SDK distributed by the
    company contains malicious functionality that tracks any URL opened by
    the app and reports it back to the company, along with performing
    advertisement attribution fraud.

    Mintegral can remotely activate hooks on the `UIApplication`, `openURL`,
    `SKStoreProductViewController`, `loadProductWithParameters` and
    `NSURLProtocol` methods along with anti-debug and proxy detection
    protection. If those hooks are active `MintegralAdSDK` sends obfuscated
    data about every opened URL in an application to their servers.

    Note that the malicious functionality is enabled even if the SDK was not
    enabled to serve ads.
