  title: Out-of-bounds Read
  description: |
    [freexl][1] is an open source library to extract valid data from within
    an Excel (.xls) spreadsheet.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Out-of-bounds Read.
    The vulnerability exists in the `parse_unicode_string` of `freexl.c`
    where it is possible for a heap-based buffer over-read to occur which
    has the potential to cause Denial of Service (DoS)

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |
    [freexl][1] is an open source library to extract valid data from within
    an Excel (.xls) spreadsheet.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). The attack can launched by sending a malicious file to
    `destroy_cell()` function, leading to heap-based buffer over-read.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package][1]

  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [freexl][1] is an open source library to extract valid data from within
    an Excel (.xls) spreadsheet.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE) via heap based buffer overflow. The library does not
    check the content and dimension of the XLS files input to the
    `read_biff_next_record()` function, allowing the vulnerability to be
    triggered when a malicious XLS file is passed to the application.

    an Excel (.xls) spreadsheet.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE) via heap based buffer overflow. The attackers can get
    full control over the heap overflow since it does not check the content
    and dimension of the XLS files input to the `read_legacy_biff()`
    function. The vulnerability can be triggered only when malicious XLS
    file is in old BIFF format.
