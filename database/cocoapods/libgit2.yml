  title: Buffer Overflow
  description: |
    [libgit2][1] is a CocoaPods package for The libgit2 Library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in
    the `git_pkt_parse_line` function. This overflow can be triggered using
    a non-flush packet.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |
    [libgit2][1] is a CocoaPods package for The libgit2 Library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS) via NULL Pointer Dereference. A malicious user can pass an empty
    packet line to the git smart protocol to cause a null pointer
    dereference that crashes the application.



    [1]: https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2.git
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package][1]

  title: Out-of-bounds Read
  description: |
    [libgit2][1] is a CocoaPods package for The libgit2 Library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Out-of-bounds Read.
    The `index.c:read_entry()` function accepts a malicious repository index
    file, leading to an index out-of-bounds read.

  description: |
    [libgit2][1] is a CocoaPods package for The libgit2 Library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS) via Double Free. The vulnerability exists due to the incorrect
    return of an error code in `read_entry()` of `index.c`, causing Denial
    of service when parsing a malicious repository index.
