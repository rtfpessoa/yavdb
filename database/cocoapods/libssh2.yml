  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: |
    [libssh2][1] is a client-side C library implementing the SSH2 protocol.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation libssh2 is vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) attacks and
    other attacks. `kex_agree_methods` function in libssh2 reads incoming
    `SSH_MSG_KEXINIT` packet data without a proper range checking of length
    values, thereby allowing remote servers to cause a denial of service by
    using malicious `SSH_MSG_KEXINIT` packet.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [libssh2][1] is a client-side C library implementing the SSH2 protocol.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. During the SSHv2 handshake when `libssh2` is to get a suitable
    value for \'group order\' in the Diffle Hellman negotiation, it would
    pass in number of bytes to a function that expected number of bits. This
    would result in the library generating numbers using only an 8th the
    number of random bits than what were intended: `128` or `256` bits
    instead of 1023 or 2047.
