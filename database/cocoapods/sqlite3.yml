    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Use After Free
    sqlite3 is vulnerable to denial of service. A malicious SQL command can
    cause a use-after-free bug that results in a denial of service condition
    and could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

  title: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
  description: |
    [sqlite3][1] is an embedded SQL database engine

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Handling of
    Exceptional Conditions. `selectExpander` in `select.c` proceeds with
    WITH stack unwinding even after a parsing error.

  title: Buffer Overflow
  description: |
    [sqlite3][1] is an embedded SQL database engine

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Buffer Overflow.
    `select.c` mishandles query-flattener optimization, leading to a
    `multiSelectOrderBy` heap overflow because of misuse of transitive
    properties for constant propagation.
