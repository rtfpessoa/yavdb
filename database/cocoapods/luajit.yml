  title: Out-of-Bounds
  description: |
    [LuaJIT][1] is a Just-In-Time Compiler for Lua.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Out-of-Bounds.
    `debug.getinfo` has a type confusion issue that leads to arbitrary
    memory write or read operations because certain cases involving valid
    stack levels and `>` options are mishandled.
