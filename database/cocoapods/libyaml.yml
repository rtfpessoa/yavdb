  title: Out-of-Bounds
  description: |
    [LibYAML][1] is a CocoaPods package for LibYAML

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Out-of-Bounds. A
    heap-based buffer overflow occurs due to not properly parsing URL in a
    YAML, allowing the attackers to trigger an arbitrary code execution
    attack using a long sequence of percent-encoded characters in a URL in a
    YAML file.
