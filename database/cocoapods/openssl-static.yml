  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [OpenSSL-Static][1] is an OpenSSL Static Libraries and CocoaPod for iOS
    and OSX. Please note that this package has reached EOL. You will no
    longer be able to download this package.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). When `SSL_read()` or `SSL_write()` is called directly after
    `SSL_do_handshake()`, `SSL_accept()` and `SSL_connect()`), leading to an
    \"error state\", if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be
    returned in the initial function call, that doesn\'t get handled
    correctly and allows the possibility for the application to crash.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
