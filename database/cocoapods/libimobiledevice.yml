  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [libimobiledevice][1] is a library to communicate with services of Apple
    iOS devices using native protocols.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control libimobiledeviceis vulnerable to exposure of iOS decive to an
    attacker placed on the local network. The attack is possible because of
    a flaw in the` socket_create` function in c`ommon/socket.c` in
    libimobiledevice and libusbmuxd, leading to the bypass of intended
    access restrictions. Therefore, the attacker can communicate with
    services on iOS devices by connecting to an IPv4 TCP socket.
