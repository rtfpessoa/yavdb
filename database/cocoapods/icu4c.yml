  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [icu4c][1] is an International Components for Unicode.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). A malicious user can pass a string to the application
    to cause a double free that can crash the application or cause arbitrary
    code to be executed.

  title: Buffer Overflow
  description: |
    [icu4c][1] is an International Components for Unicode.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. A
    malicious user can pass a string to the `ucnv_UTF8FromUTF8` function in
    `ucnv_u8.cpp` to cause a buffer overflow that can crash the application
    or cause arbitrary code to be executed.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |
    [icu4c][1] is a International Components for Unicode.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). via Buffer Overflow. The `common/utext.cpp` file has a flaw that
    allows a malicious user to cause an out-of-bounds write by passing a
    string to the application. This can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow
    that can crash the application.

    \##Details Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all
    aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate
    users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
