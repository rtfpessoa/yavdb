  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [GCDWebServer][1] is a modern and lightweight GCD based HTTP 1.1 server
    designed to be embedded in iOS, macOS &amp; tvOS apps.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. An issue was discovered in GCDWebServer before 3.5.3. The
    method moveItem in the GCDWebUploader class checks the FileExtension of
    newAbsolutePath but not oldAbsolutePath. By leveraging this
    vulnerability, an adversary can make an inaccessible file be available
    (the credential of the app, for instance).
