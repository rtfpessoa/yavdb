  title: SSL Certificate Bypass
  description: |
    [StarscreamSocketIO][1] is a fork of Starscream, a conforming WebSocket
    (RFC 6455) client library in Swift for iOS and OSX.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SSL Certificate
    Bypass. Allows an SSL Pinning bypass because of incorrect management of
    the `certValidated` variable (it can be set to true but cannot be set to
    false). If an attacker in a man-in-the-middle position is able to reset
    an established TCP connection between the client and server, the
    subsequent re-connection will not pin the SSL certificate, allowing
    traffic interception.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SSL Certificate
    Bypass. `WebSocket.swift` allows an SSL Pinning bypass because pinning
    occurs in the stream function (this is too late; pinning should occur in
    the `initStreamsWithData` function).
