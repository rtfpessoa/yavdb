  title: NULL Pointer Dereference
  description: |
    [libetpan][1] is a portable, efficient framework for different kinds of
    mail access: IMAP, SMTP, POP and NNTP.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to NULL Pointer
    Dereference. A null dereference vulnerability has been found in the MIME
    handling component, as used in MailCore and MailCore 2. A crash can
    occur in `low-level/imf/mailimf.c` during a failed parse of a `CC`
    header , containing multiple e-mail addresses.

  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [libetpan][1] is a portable, efficient framework for different kinds of
    mail access: IMAP, SMTP, POP and NNTP.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM). LibEtPan has a STARTTLS buffering issue that affects the IMAP,
    SMTP, and POP3 protocol. When a server sends a \"begin TLS\" response,
    the client reads additional data (e.g., from a meddler-in-the-middle
    attacker) and evaluates it in a TLS context, aka \"response injection.\"
