  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: |
    [Cordova][1] is a CocoaPods package for Cordova iOS

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation. It is possible to bypass whitelist protection mechanism
    within Cordova due to missing validations. The vulnerability is possible
    because it does not anchor the end of domain-name regular expressions.
    Therefore, it allows attacker to bypass the protection by using a domain
    name that has an acceptable name as an initial substring.

  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [Cordova][1] is a CocoaPods package for Cordova iOS

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. Cordova is vulnerable to the bypass of intended device-resource
    restrictions. Leveraging on an event-based bridge, a library clone, and
    an IFRAME script execution, a remote attacker is able to wait for a
    certain amount of time for an OnJsPrompt handler return value as an
    alternative to correct synchronization to bypass these restrictions.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. Leveraging on an event-based bridge, a library clone, and an
    IFRAME script execution, a remote attacker is able to directly access
    bridge JavaScript objects as demonstrated by certain `cordova.require`
    calls.
