  title: Insecure Default
  description: |
    [AFNetworking][1] is a delightful iOS and OS X networking framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Default.
    The default `AFSecurityPolicy.validatesDomainName` configuration for
    `AFSSLPinningModeNone` in the `AFNetworking framework ` disables
    verification of a server hostname against the domain name in the
    subject\'s Common Name (CN) of the X.509 certificate, which allows
    man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid
    certificate.
