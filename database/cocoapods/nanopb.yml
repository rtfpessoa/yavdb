  title: Out-of-bounds Read
  description: |
    [nanopb][1] is a plain-C implementation of Google\'s Protocol Buffers
    data format.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Out-of-bounds Read.
    It might call `free()` on a pointer value that comes from uninitialized
    memory, with the following conditions:

    1.  It is compiled with `PB_ENABLE_MALLOC`
    2.  the message to be decoded contains a repeated string, bytes or
        message field
    3.  `realloc()` runs out of memory when expanding the array

    Depending on platform this can result in a crash or further memory
    corruption, which may be exploitable in some cases.
